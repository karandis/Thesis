- Massive stars in the context of astronomy and astrophysics
- - the importance of massive stars
  - inject energy and angular momentum through end-of-life explosions such as core-collapse supernovae
  - drive the evolution of galaxies
  - can trigger or inhibit star formation
  - progenitors of BH and NS.

- Binarity in massive stars

- Wolf-Rayet stars

As they evolve, massive stars with M$_i \gtrsim 30\,$\Msun{} will strip their outer envelope either through sufficient mass loss via stellar winds or through mass transfer onto a binary companion star. The contribution of each formation channel is still widely debated \citep{}
