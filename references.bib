Refined near-infrared (YHJK) classification criteria based on over a hundred Galactic and Magellanic Cloud WR stars, providing diagnostics for hydrogen in WN stars, plus the identification of WO stars and intermediate WN/C stars.

Candidates were selected by their near-infrared (Two Micron All Sky Survey; 2MASS) and mid-infrared (Spitzer/GLIMPSE) color excesses, which are consistent with free-free emission from ionized stellar winds and thermal excess from hot dust. We have confirmed 12 new Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galactic disk, including nine of the nitrogen subtype (WN), and three of the carbon subtype (WC); this raises the total number of Wolf-Rayet stars discovered with our approach to 27. We classify one of the new stars as a possible dust-producing WC9d + OBI colliding-wind binary, as evidenced by an infrared excess resembling that of known WC9d stars, the detection of OBI features superimposed on the WC9 spectrum, and hard X-ray emission detected by XMM-Newton. A WC8 star in our sample appears to be a member of the stellar cluster Danks 1, in contrast to the rest of the confirmed Wolf-Rayet stars that generally do not appear to reside within dense stellar clusters. Either the majority of the stars are runaways from clusters, or they formed in relative isolation. We briefly discuss prospects for the expansion and improvement of the search for Wolf-Rayet stars throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.},

	abstract = {We have spectroscopically identified 60 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, including 38 nitrogen types (WN) and 22 carbon types (WC). Using photometry from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE and Two Micron All Sky Survey databases, the new WRs were selected via a method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors, which is mainly the result of excess radiation generated by free-free scattering within their dense ionized winds. The selection criterion has been refined since the last report, resulting in a WR detection rate of ?20\% in spectroscopic follow-up of candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution of all known WRs having B {\textgreater} 14 mag. However, there are smaller regions within this color space that yield WRs at a rate of {\textgreater}50\% in spectroscopic follow-up. Candidates that are not WRs are mainly Be stars, which is possibly attributable to the physical similarities between the free-free emission parameters of Be disks and WR winds. As an additional selection experiment, the list of WR candidates was cross-correlated with archival X-ray point-source catalogs, which increases the WR detection rate of the broad color space to ?40\% 10 new WR X-ray sources have been found in addition to a previously unrecognized X-ray counterpart to a known WR. The extinction values, distances, and Galactocentric radii of all new WRs are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Although the majority of the new WRs have no obvious association with stellar clusters, two WC8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive-star cluster, in which five OB supergiants were also identified. The new system lies at an estimated distance of ?6.1 kpc, near the intersection of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm with the Galaxy's bar. In addition, two WC and four WN stars, all but one of which are X-ray sources, were identified in association with the stellar clusters Danks 1 and 2. A WN9 star has also been associated with the cluster [DBS2003] 179. This work brings the total number of known Galactic WRs to 476, or ?7\%-8\% of the total empirically estimated population. An examination of their Galactic distribution reveals an approximate tracing of the spiral arms and an enhanced WR surface density toward several massive-star formation sites.},

Using a sample of spectrally classified objects, we find that WR stars are well distinguished from the field stellar population in the (W1 - W2) versus (J - Ks ) color-color diagram, and further distinguished from other emission line objects such as planetary nebulae, Be, and cataclysmic variable stars using a combination of NIR and MIR color constraints. As proof of concept we applied the color constraints to a photometric sample in the Galactic plane, located WR star candidates, and present five new spectrally confirmed and classified WC (1) and WN (4) stars. Analysis of the 0.8-5.0 $\mu$m spectral data for a subset of known, bright WC and WN stars shows that emission lines (primarily He I) extend into the 3.0-5.0 $\mu$m spectral region, although their strength is greatly diminished compared to the 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m region. The WR population stands out relative to background field stars at NIR and MIR colors due to an excess continuum contribution, likely caused by free-free scattering in dense winds. Mean photometric properties of known WRs are presented and imply that reddened late-type WN and WC sources are easier to detect than earlier-type sources at larger Galactic radii. WISE W3 and W4 images of 10 WR stars show evidence of circumstellar shells linked to mass ejections from strong stellar winds.},

The high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring survey of O and WN stars (OWN Survey, Barb{\'a} et al. 2010) has completed seven years of sustained campaign, using observational facilities in Chile and Argentina. The selected sample corresponds to those stars for which there is no indication of multiplicity in the Galactic O-star Catalog (Ma{\'i}z Apell{\'a}niz et al. 2004) and the VII Catalogue of Galactic WR stars (van der Hucht 2001). We have collected almost 5000 spectra of about 240 O and WN stars. From that sample of 190 O-type stars, we have discovered 146 stars showing radial variations greater than 10 km/s, including 108 new systems, being 56 single-lined spectroscopic binaries, 43 double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and 9 multiple-lined binaries. The new orbital periods spanning from 1.5 to 2200 days. In this work, we present the main result of ``OWN Survey'': the determination of orbits for over fifty O-type spectroscopic binary systems, and the analysis of the spectral-type, luminosty, period, eccentricity, and mass-ratio distributions. This result is unprecedented in the context of massive binary stars, since we are almost doubling the number of Galactic O-type star systems with known orbits.},

	abstract = {Context. Massive binaries play a crucial role in the Universe. Knowing the distributions of their orbital parameters is important for a wide range of topics from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels and from the distribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet no direct measurements exist outside the Milky Way. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring project was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial velocity (RV) monitoring of 102 massive binaries in the 30 Doradus region. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: In this paper we analyze 32 FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier analysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single-lined (SB1) and 31 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Overall, the binary fraction and orbital properties across the 30 Doradus region are found to be similar to existing Galactic samples. This indicates that within these domains environmental effects are of second order in shaping the properties of massive binary systems. A small difference is found in the distribution of orbital periods, which is slightly flatter (in log space) in 30 Doradus than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible within error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, orbital periods in 30 Doradus can be as short as 1.1 d, somewhat shorter than seen in Galactic samples. Equal mass binaries (q\&gt; 0.95) in 30 Doradus are all found outside NGC 2070, the central association that surrounds R136a, the very young and massive cluster at 30 Doradus's core. Most of the differences, albeit small, are compatible with expectations from binary evolution. One outstanding exception, however, is the fact that earlier spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter orbital periods than later spectral types (O9.2-O9.7). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results point to a relative universality of the incidence rate of massive binaries and their orbital properties in the metallicity range from solar (Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) to about half solar. This provides the first direct constraints on massive binary properties in massive star-forming galaxies at the Universe's peak of star formation at redshifts z 1 to 2 which are estimated to have Z 0.5 Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The log of observations and RV measurements for all targets are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} ({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}http://130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/598/A84"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/598/A84{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {During the summer of 2013, a 4-month spectroscopic campaign took place to observe the variabilities in three Wolf-Rayet stars. The spectroscopic data have been analysed for WR 134 (WN6b), to better understand its behaviour and long-term periodicity, which we interpret as arising from corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the wind. By analysing the variability of the He II $\lambda$5411 emission line, the previously identified period was refined to P = 2.255 {\textpm} 0.008 (s.d.) d. The coherency time of the variability, which we associate with the lifetime of the CIRs in the wind, was deduced to be 40 {\textpm} 6 d, or \~{}18 cycles, by cross-correlating the variability patterns as a function of time. When comparing the phased observational grey-scale difference images with theoretical grey-scales previously calculated from models including CIRs in an optically thin stellar wind, we find that two CIRs were likely present. A separation in longitude of $\Delta$$\varphi$ ? 90{\textdegree} was determined between the two CIRs and we suggest that the different maximum velocities that they reach indicate that they emerge from different latitudes. We have also been able to detect observational signatures of the CIRs in other spectral lines (C IV $\lambda$$\lambda$5802,5812 and He I $\lambda$5876). Furthermore, a DAC was found to be present simultaneously with the CIR signatures detected in the He I $\lambda$5876 emission line which is consistent with the proposed geometry of the large-scale structures in the wind. Small-scale structures also show a presence in the wind, simultaneously with the larger scale structures, showing that they do in fact co-exist.},

	abstract = {Observations have suggested substantial departures from pressure equilibrium in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the plane of the Galaxy, even on scales under 50 pc. Nevertheless, multiphase models of the ISM assume at least locally isobaric gas. The pressure then determines the density reached by gas cooling to stable thermal equilibrium. We use numerical models of the magnetized ISM to examine the consequences of supernova driving for interstellar pressures. In this paper we examine a (200 pc)3 periodic domain threaded by magnetic fields. Individual parcels of gas at different pressures reach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set of phases is found but rather a dynamically determined continuum of densities and temperatures. A substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium. Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures. They also suggest that the high pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to ram pressures in addition to gravitational forces. Much of the gas in our model lies far from equipartition between thermal and magnetic pressures, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to 104 and ratios of uniform to fluctuating magnetic field of 0.5-1. Our models show broad pressure probability distribution functions with log-normal functional forms produced by both shocks and rarefaction waves rather than power-law distributions produced by isolated supernova remnants. The width of the distribution can be described quantitatively by a formula derived from the work of Padoan, Nordlund, \& Jones.},

In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

We review here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions (GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference.},

There are many triple systems among the speckle binaries, and we discuss their possible role in the ejection of stars from clusters. The period distribution of the binaries is bimodal in log P, but we suggest that binaries with periods of years and decades may eventually be found to fill the gap. The mass ratio distribution of the visual binaries increases toward lower mass ratios, but low mass ratio companions are rare among close, spectroscopic binaries (probably because of the difficulty of spectroscopic detection rather than a real deficit). We present distributions of the eccentricity and longitude of periastron for spectroscopic binaries with elliptical orbits, and we find strong evidence of a bias in the longitude of periastron distribution (the ``Barr effect''), which is probably caused by line distortions introduced by circumstellar gas.},

We report on the discovery of companions to 14 OB stars. In total we resolved companions of 41 of 385 O-stars (11\%), 4 of 37 Wolf-Rayet stars (11\%), and 89 of 139 B-stars (64\%; an enriched visual binary sample that we selected for future orbital determinations). We made a statistical analysis of the binary frequency among the subsample that are listed in the Galactic O Star Catalog by compiling published data on other visual companions detected through adaptive optics studies and/or noted in the Washington Double Star Catalog and by collecting published information on radial velocities and spectroscopic binaries. We find that the binary frequency is much higher among O-stars in clusters and associations compared to the numbers for field and runaway O-stars, consistent with predictions for the ejection processes for runaway stars. We present a first orbit for the O-star $\delta$ Orionis; a linear solution of the close, apparently optical, companion of the O-star $\iota$ Orionis; and an improved orbit of the Be star $\delta$ Scorpii.

The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is our closest view of a starburst region and is the ideal environment to investigate important questions regarding the formation, evolution and final fate of the most massive stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive O-type star population observed through multi-epoch spectroscopy in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey. With 360 O-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample of massive stars analyzed to date. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identify spectroscopic binaries. We also use a Monte-Carlo method to correct for observational biases. By modeling simultaneously the observed binary fraction, the distributions of the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations and the distribution of the time scales of these variations, we constrain the intrinsic current binary fraction and period and mass-ratio distributions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35 {\textpm} 0.03, which corresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significant radial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We compute the intrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51 {\textpm} 0.04. We adopt power-laws to describe the intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f(log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d) {\textasciitilde} (log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}$\pi${\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (with log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d in the range 0.15-3.5) and f(q) {\textasciitilde} q{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}$\kappa${\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} with 0.1 <= q = M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} <= 1.0. The power-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are $\pi$ = -0.45 {\textpm} 0.30 and $\kappa$ = -1.0 {\textpm} 0.4. The period distribution that we obtain thus favours shorter period systems compared to an {\"O}pik law ($\pi$ = 0). The mass ratio distribution is slightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with a random sampling of a classical mass function ($\kappa$ = -2.35). The binary fraction seems mostly uniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types and luminosity classes. The binary fraction in the outer region of the field of view (r \&gt; 7.8', i.e. ?117 pc) and among the O9.7 I/II objects are however significantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations. The observed and intrinsic binary fractions are also lower for the faintest objects in our sample (K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 15.5 mag), which results from observational effects and the fact that our O star sample is not magnitude-limited but is defined by a spectral-type cutoff. We also conclude that magnitude-limited investigations are biased towards larger binary fractions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Using the multiplicity properties of the O stars in the Tarantula region and simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over 50\% of the current O star population will exchange mass with its companion within a binary system. This shows that binary interaction is greatly affecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken into account to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under program ID 182.D-0222.Full Tables 1-3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater}({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/550/A107"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/550/A107{\textless}/A{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Multiplicity is one of the most fundamental observable properties of massive O-type stars and offers a promising way to discriminate between massive star formation theories. Nevertheless, companions at separations between 1 and 100 milliarcsec (mas) remain mostly unknown due to intrinsic observational limitations. At a typical distance of 2 kpc, this corresponds to projected physical separations of 2-200 AU. The Southern MAssive Stars at High angular resolution survey (SMaSH+) was designed to fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey of Galactic massive stars. We observed 117 O-type stars with VLTI/PIONIER and 162 O-type stars with NACO/Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM), probing the separation ranges 1-45 and 30-250 mas and brightness contrasts of $\Delta$H {\textless} 4 and $\Delta$H {\textless} 5, respectively. Taking advantage of NACO's field of view, we further uniformly searched for visual companions in an 8'' radius down to $\Delta$H = 8. This paper describes observations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 new companions in the separation range from 1 mas to 8'' and presents a catalog of detections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen known long-period spectroscopic binaries. Excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96 objects in our main sample ($\delta$ {\textless} 0{\textdegree} H {\textless} 7.5) were observed both with PIONIER and NACO/SAM. The fraction of these stars with at least one resolved companion within 200 mas is 0.53. Accounting for known but unresolved spectroscopic or eclipsing companions, the multiplicity fraction at separation $\rho$ {\textless} 8'' increases to f m = 0.91 {\textpm} 0.03. The fraction of luminosity class V stars that have a bound companion reaches 100\% at 30 mas while their average number of physically connected companions within 8'' is f c = 2.2 {\textpm} 0.3. This demonstrates that massive stars form nearly exclusively in multiple systems. The nine non-thermal radio emitters observed by SMaSH+ are all resolved, including the newly discovered pairs HD 168112 and CPD-47{\textdegree}2963. This lends strong support to the universality of the wind-wind collision scenario to explain the non-thermal emission from O-type stars.},

	abstract = {We analyze orbital solutions for 48 massive multiple-star systems in the Cygnus OB2 association, 23 of which are newly presented here, to find that the observed distribution of orbital periods is approximately uniform in log P for P {\textless} 45 days, but it is not scale-free. Inflections in the cumulative distribution near 6 days, 14 days, and 45 days suggest key physical scales of sime0.2, sime0.4, and sime1 A.U. where yet-to-be-identified phenomena create distinct features. No single power law provides a statistically compelling prescription, but if features are ignored, a power law with exponent $\beta$ {\textasciitilde}= -0.22 provides a crude approximation over P = 1.4-2000 days, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45 days. The cumulative period distribution flattens at P {\textgreater} 45 days, even after correction for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or a shift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91\% likelihood) between the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests that the binary properties at P {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 25 days are determined by local physics of disk/clump fragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionary factors. Fully 30\% of the unbiased parent sample is a binary with period P {\textless} 45 days. Completeness corrections imply a binary fraction near 55\% for P {\textless} 5000 days. The observed distribution of mass ratios 0.2 {\textless} q {\textless} 1 is consistent with uniform, while the observed distribution of eccentricities 0.1 {\textless} e {\textless} 0.6 is consistent with uniform plus an excess of e {\textasciitilde}= 0 systems. We identify six stars, all supergiants, that exhibit aperiodic velocity variations of {\textasciitilde}30 km s-1 attributed to atmospheric fluctuations.},

The high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring survey of O and WN stars (OWN Survey, Barb{\'a} et al. 2010) has completed seven years of sustained campaign, using observational facilities in Chile and Argentina. The selected sample corresponds to those stars for which there is no indication of multiplicity in the Galactic O-star Catalog (Ma{\'i}z Apell{\'a}niz et al. 2004) and the VII Catalogue of Galactic WR stars (van der Hucht 2001). We have collected almost 5000 spectra of about 240 O and WN stars. From that sample of 190 O-type stars, we have discovered 146 stars showing radial variations greater than 10 km/s, including 108 new systems, being 56 single-lined spectroscopic binaries, 43 double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and 9 multiple-lined binaries. The new orbital periods spanning from 1.5 to 2200 days. In this work, we present the main result of ``OWN Survey'': the determination of orbits for over fifty O-type spectroscopic binary systems, and the analysis of the spectral-type, luminosty, period, eccentricity, and mass-ratio distributions. This result is unprecedented in the context of massive binary stars, since we are almost doubling the number of Galactic O-type star systems with known orbits.},

Among massive stars, those of O type play a crucial role due to their high masses and short lifetimes. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: MONOS (Multiplicity Of Northern O-type Spectroscopic systems) is a project designed to collect information and study O-type spectroscopic binaries with $\delta$ \&gt; -20{\textdegree}. In this first paper we describe the sample and provide spectral classifications and additional information for objects with previous spectroscopic and/or eclipsing binary orbits. In future papers we will test the validity of previous solutions and calculate new spectroscopic orbits. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The spectra in this paper have two sources: the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), a project that obtains blue-violet R \~{} 2500 spectroscopy of thousands of massive stars, and LiLiMaRlin, a library of libraries of high-resolution spectroscopy of massive stars obtained from four different surveys (CAF{\'E}-BEANS, OWN, IACOB, and NoMaDS) and additional data from our own observing programs and public archives. We have also used lucky images obtained with AstraLux. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We present homogeneous spectral classifications for 92 O-type spectroscopic multiple systems and ten optical companions, many of them original. We discuss the visual multiplicity of each system with the support of AstraLux images and additional sources. For eleven O-type objects and for six B-type objects we present their first GOSSS spectral classifications. For two known eclipsing binaries we detect double absorption lines (SB2) or a single moving line (SB1) for the first time, to which we add a third system reported by us recently. For two previous SB1 systems we detect their SB2 nature for the first time and give their first separate spectral classifications, something we have also done for a third object just recently identified as a SB2. We also detect nine new astrometric companions and provide updated information on several others. We emphasize the results for two stars: for $\sigma$ Ori AaAbB we provide spectral classifications for the three components with a single observation for the first time thanks to a lucky spectroscopy observation obtained close to the Aa,Ab periastron and for $\theta${\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Ori CaCb we add it to the class of Galactic Of?p stars, raising the number of its members to six.

	abstract = {Context. It is well known that massive O stars are frequently (if not always) found in binary or higher-order multiple systems, but this fact has been less robustly investigated for the lower mass range of the massive stars, represented by B-type stars. Obtaining the binary fraction and orbital parameter distributions of B-type stars is crucial to understand the impact of multiplicity on the archetypal progenitor of core-collapse supernovae as well as to properly investigate formation channels for gravitational wave progenitors. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: This work aims to characterise the multiplicity of the B star population of the young open cluster NGC 6231 through multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of 80 B-type stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We analyse 31 FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations of 80 B-type stars, monitoring their radial velocities (RVs) and performing a least-squares spectral analysis (Lomb-Scargle) to search for periodicity in those stars with statistically significant variability in their RVs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We constrained an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of 33 {\textpm} 5\% for the B-type stars of NGC 6231, with a first order bias correction giving a true spectroscopic binary fraction of 52 {\textpm} 8\%.

We present these orbital solutions and the orbital parameter distributions associated with them. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results indicate that Galactic B-type stars are less frequently found in binary systems than their more massive O-type counterparts, but their orbital properties generally resemble those of B- and O-type stars in both the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables C.1-C.5 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A69"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A69{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the ESO Paranal observatory under ESO program 099.D-0895 and 0101.D-0163.},

	abstract = {We present results from the B-type binaries characterization (BBC) programme, a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of 88 early B-type binary candidates in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From radial-velocity analysis of 29 observational epochs, we confirm the binary status of 64 of our targets, comprising 50 SB1 and 14 SB2 B-type binaries. A further 20 systems (classified as SB1*) show clear signs of periodicity but with more tentative periods. Orbital solutions are presented for these 84 systems, providing the largest homogeneous sample to date of the binary properties of early B-type stars. Our derived orbital-period distribution is generally similar to those for samples of more massive (O-type) binaries in both the LMC and the Galaxy. This similarity with the properties of the more massive O-type binaries is important as early B-type stars are expected to account for the majority of core-collapse supernovae. Differences in the period distributions of the different samples start to increase above 4 d, and are also present between the earliest (B0-0.7) and later-type (B1-2.5) systems within the BBC sample, although further study is required to understand if this is an observational bias or a real physical effect. We have examined the semi-amplitude velocities and orbital periods of our sample to identify potential candidates that could hide compact companions. Comparing with probability distributions of finding black hole companions to OB-type stars from a recent theoretical study, we have found 16 binaries in the higher probability region that warrant further study.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity.

	abstract = {Understanding massive stars is essential for a variety of branches of astronomy including galaxy and star cluster evolution, nucleosynthesis and supernovae, pulsars, and black holes. It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage. I show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

	abstract = {Context: .Recent results strongly challenge the canonical picture of massive star winds: various evidence indicates that currently accepted mass-loss rates, \{dot M\}, may need to be revised downwards, by factors extending to one magnitude or even more. This is because the most commonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by "clumping" (small-scale density inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra and fluxes.{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: .Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the evolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations of the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. We present a first attempt concerning this objective, by means of constraining the radial stratification of the so-called clumping factor.{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: .To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type supergiants/giants, by combining our own and archival data for H$\alpha$, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and using approximate methods, calibrated to more sophisticated models. Clumping has been included into our analysis in the "conventional" way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be void. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we cannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a certain minimum.{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: .This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost, radio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones, compared to \{dot M\} derived from H$\alpha$ and the IR. The radio rates agree well with those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown clumping in the outer wind. H$\alpha$ turned out to be a useful tool to derive the clumping properties inside r \&lt; 3\{ldots\}5 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Our most important result concerns a (physical) difference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost region is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized clumping factor of 4.1 {\textpm} 1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping properties in the inner and outer regions.{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: .Our findings are compared with theoretical predictions, and the implications are discussed in detail, by assuming different scenarios regarding the still unknown clumping properties of the outer wind.},

When P+4 is the dominant ion in the wind [i.e., 0.5{\textless}{\textasciitilde}q(P+4){\textless}=1], M?q(P+4) approximates the mass-loss rate to within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2. Theory predicts that P+4 is the dominant ion in the winds of O7-O9.7 stars, although an empirical estimator suggests that the range O4-O7 may be more appropriate. However, we find that the mass-loss rates obtained from P V wind profiles are systematically smaller than those obtained from fits to H$\alpha$ emission profiles or radio free-free emission by median factors of {\textasciitilde}130 (if P+4 is dominant between O7 and O9.7) or {\textasciitilde}20 (if P+4 is dominant between O4 and O7). These discordant measurements can be reconciled if the winds of O stars in the relevant temperature range are strongly clumped on small spatial scales. We use a simplified two-component model to investigate the volume filling factors of the denser regions. This clumping implies that mass-loss rates determined from ``$\rho$2'' diagnostics have been systematically overestimated by factors of 10 or more, at least for a subset of O stars. Reductions in the mass-loss rates of this size have important implications for the evolution of massive stars and quantitative estimates of the feedback that hot-star winds provide to their interstellar environments.},

	abstract = {We describe a new technique involving wavelet transforms for analyzing discrete stochastic components like those found on the tops of emission lines in Wolf-Rayet stars. A wavelet power spectrum is used to characterize the variable component of the emission line we believe arises from the superposition of many individual Gaussian-like subpeaks. This was applied to emission-line spectra of eight Wolf-Rayet stars obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and European Southern Observatory. Where the data show the most power we identify a dominant scale, which is found to be very similar in all but one of the stars in our sample. We present a phenomenological model where the variable structure on top of the emission line is represented by a sum of individual subpeaks of the same simple shape (Gaussian or triangular) and various scales. This model is used to introduce the idea of scaling laws. The amplitude A and number density N of subpeaks on a given scale are related to their characteristic width $\sigma$ (i.e., velocity dispersion) by scaling relations, of which the simplest form is a power law: A \~{} $\sigma$$\alpha$ and N \~{} $\sigma$$\beta$. The wavelet power spectrum is used to verify the consistency of this model with the data. Synthetic signals are generated, and their wavelet spectra are compared to those of the data. This provides a constraint on the value of 2$\alpha$ + $\beta$, which is found to be 2.7{\textpm}0.5(s.d.) for the model involving Gaussians, or ?3.4{\textpm}0.6(s.d.) for the model involving triangles.

The Wolf-Rayet star HD 192103 (=WR 135; subtype WC8) was observed in the 5650-5840 {\r A} regime alternately from both the William Herschel Telescope and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The final data consist of a series of 197 spectra spread over 64 hr, each with a resolving power $\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda${\textasciitilde}=20,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio in the continuum {\textasciitilde}=450 per 3 pixel resolution element. We clearly and unambiguously identify stochastic, structured patterns of intrinsic variability at the 1\%-2\% level of the line flux in the broad C III $\lambda$5696 emission line. The $\lambda$5801/12 doublet emission is also found to be variable at the 0.2\%-0.5\% level of the line flux. We find a correlation between the variability patterns observed in C III and C IV, which suggests a significant overlap in the emission volumes of these transitions, although C IV is known to arise somewhat closer to the star. We attempt to reproduce the observed line profile variation patterns using a simple phenomenological model, which assumes the wind to be fully clumped. With a minimal set of assumptions, we are able to reproduce both the shape and the variability in the C III $\lambda$5696 emission profile. We show that the variability pattern provides constraints on the radial extent of WR 135's wind where C III is produced, as well as on the local wind acceleration rate. However, our simple clump model does not reproduce the lower variability in the C IV doublet unless we assume the C IV emission to occur in a much larger volume than C III, implying that significant C IV emission occurs farther out in the wind than C III. We suggest that while some C IV emission might occur farther out, possibly because of reionization from shocks, a more likely explanation is that wind clumping significantly increases with distance from the star, leading to larger variability levels in C III, formed farther out than most of C IV. Alternatively, optical depth effects and/or local ionization gradients within clumps could conspire to attenuate clumping effects in the C IV emission line while enhancing them in the C III line.},

For each star in our sample, we obtained 4-5 high-resolution spectra with signal-to-noise ratio {\textasciitilde}100. Our ultimate goal is to identify new candidates presenting variability that potentially comes from corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Out of a sample of 25 stars, 10 were found to display large-scale changes of which four are of CIR-type (WR 1, WR 115, WR 120, and WR 134). The star WR 134 was already known to show such changes from previous studies. Three WN8 stars present a different type of large-scale variability and we believe deserve a group of their own. Also, all three WC9d stars in our sample present large-scale variability, but it remains to be checked if these are binaries, as many dust-making WR stars are double. Finally, of the remaining stars, 10 were found to show small-amplitude spectral changes, which we attribute to normal line-profile variability due to inhomogeneities in the wind, and five were found to show no spectral variability, as far as can be concluded from the data in hand. Follow-up studies are required to identify potential periods for our candidates showing CIR-type changes and eventually estimate a rotation rate for these WR stars.},

In a previous paper (Paper I), we described and characterized the spectroscopic variability level of 25 WR stars observable from the northern hemisphere and found 3 new candidates presenting large-scale wind variability, potentially originating from large-scale structures named corotating interaction regions (CIRs). In this second paper, we discuss an additional 39 stars observable from the southern hemisphere. For each star in our sample, we obtained 4-5 high-resolution spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of {\textasciitilde}100 and determined its variability level using the approach described in Paper I. In total, 10 new stars are found to show large-scale spectral variability of which 7 present CIR-type changes (WR 8, WR 44, WR55, WR 58, WR 61, WR 63, WR 100). Of the remaining stars, 20 were found to show small-amplitude changes and 9 were found to show no spectral variability as far as can be concluded from the data on hand. Also, we discuss the spectroscopic variability level of all single galactic WR stars that are brighter than v {\textasciitilde} 12.5, and some WR stars with 12.5 {\textless} v {\textless}= 13.5, i.e., all the stars presented in our two papers and four more stars for which spectra have already been published in the literature. We find that 23/68 stars (33.8\%) present large-scale variability, but only 12/54 stars ({\textasciitilde}22.1\%) are potentially of CIR type. Also, we find that 31/68 stars (45.6\%) only show small-scale variability, most likely due to clumping in the wind. Finally, no spectral variability is detected based on the data on hand for 14/68 (20.6\%) stars.

These three stars have T* = 140 and 200 kK, the last two being well above the bulk of WR stars with T* \~{} 40-120 kK. This full temperature range for WR stars is much broader than that of their O-star progenitors (\~{}30-50 kK), so is better suited to look for any temperature dependence of wind clumping. We have obtained multiple observations with high signal-to-noise, moderate-resolution spectroscopy in search of small-scale variability in the strong emission lines from the dense winds of these three extreme stars, and find a very low-level of variability in both stars. Temperature and terminal velocity are correlated, so faster winds show a lower variability, though this trend goes against any predictions made involving Line Deshadowing Instability (LDI) only, implying that instabilities intrinsic to LDI are not the main source of wind clumping. Instead, it could be taken as support for the suggestion that clumps are caused by a subsurface convection zone (SSCZ) at T \~{} 170 kK, since such an SSCZ would have little opportunity to operate under the hydrostatic surface of these hottest WR stars. It is still possible, however, that an SSCZ-related driver could interact with nonlinear line instability effects to enhance or possibly even produce clumps.},

We present observations of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}WR 1{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} which highlight the unusual character of the variations in this object. Our narrowband photometric observations reveal a gradual increase of the stellar continuum flux amounting to Delta v {\textasciitilde} 0.09 mag followed by a decline on about the same timescale (3-4 days). Only marginal evidence for variability is found during the 11 following nights. Strong, daily line-profile variations are also observed but they cannot be easily linked to the photometric variations. Similarly to the continuum flux variations, coherent time-dependent changes are observed in 1996 in the centroid, equivalent width, and skewness of He Ii lambda 4686. Despite the generally coherent nature of the variations, we do not find evidence in our data for the periods claimed in previous studies. While the issue of a cyclical pattern of variability in {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}WR 1{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is still controversial, it is clear that this object might constitute in the future a cornerstone for our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the formation of largely anisotropic outflows in Wolf-Rayet stars.},

In this paper, we set out to verify if a simplified analytical model in which corotating interaction regions (CIRs) threading an otherwise spherical wind is able to reproduce the many broad-band continuum light curves from the literature with a reasonable set of parameters. We modified the optically thin model developed by Ignace, St-Louis \& Proulx-Giraldeau to approximately account for multiple scattering and used it to fit 13 separate data sets of this star. By including two CIRs in the wind, we obtained reasonable fits for all data sets with coherent values for the inclination of the rotation axis (i0 = 166{\textdegree}) and for its orientation in the plane of the sky, although in the latter case we obtained two equally acceptable values ($\psi$ = 63{\textdegree} and 152{\textdegree}) from the polarimetry. Additional line profile variation simulations using the Sobolev approximation for the line transfer allowed us to eliminate the $\psi$ = 152{\textdegree} solution. With the adopted configuration (i0 = 166{\textdegree} and $\psi$ = 63{\textdegree}), we were able to reproduce all data sets relatively well with two CIRs located near the stellar equator and always separated by \~{}90{\textdegree} in longitude. The epoch dependence comes from the fact that these CIRs migrate along the surface of the star. Density contrasts smaller than a factor of 2 and large opening angles for the CIR ($\beta$ ? 35{\textdegree}) were found to best reproduce the type of spectroscopic variability reported in the literature.},

A new eclipsing binary, HD 92740, has been discovered; other stars show periodic variations which can be explained by phase-dependent scattering of the secondary light as it traverses the Wolf-Rayet wind.

Application to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR stars generally lie in the thin disc (\~{}40 pc half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric radii 3.5-10 kpc, in accordance with other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR stars located at vertical distances of >=300 pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting for close binary evolution are more consistent with observations. We consolidate information acquired about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build a simple model of the complete population. We derive observable quantities over a range of wavelengths, allowing us to estimate a total number of 1900 {\textpm} 250 Galactic WR stars, implying an average duration of \~{} 0.4 Myr for the WR phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate. Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use this model WR population to predict follow-up spectroscopy to KS ? 17.5 mag will be necessary to identify 95 per cent of Galactic WR stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will make few additional WR star discoveries via low-resolution spectroscopy, though will significantly refine existing distance determinations.

The comparison among WISE images in different bands and optical images proves to be a very efficient procedure to identify the nebular emission from WR nebulae, and to disentangle it from that of the ISM material along the line of sight. In particular, WR nebulae are clearly detected in the WISE W4 band at 22 $\mu$m. Analysis of available mid-IR Spitzer spectra shows that the emission in this band is dominated by thermal emission from dust spatially coincident with the thin nebular shell or most likely with the leading edge of the nebula. The WR nebulae in our sample present different morphologies that we classified into well defined WR bubbles (bubble ?-type nebulae), clumpy and/or disrupted shells (clumpy/disrupted C-type nebulae), and material mixed with the diffuse medium (mixed ?-type nebulae). The variety of morphologies presented by WR nebulae shows a loose correlation with the central star spectral type, implying that the nebular and stellar evolutions are not simple and may proceed according to different sequences and time-lapses.

	abstract = {Context. Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are massive, hydrogen-depleted, post main-sequence stars that exhibit emission-line dominated spectra. For a given metallicity Z, stars exceeding a certain initial mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) can reach the WR phase through intrinsic mass-loss or eruptions (single-star channel). In principle, stars of lower masses can reach the WR phase via stripping through binary interactions (binary channel). Because winds become weaker at low Z, it is commonly assumed that the binary channel dominates the formation of WR stars in environments with low metallicity such as the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC). However, the reported WR binary fractions of 30-40\% in the SMC (Z = 0.002) and LMC (Z = 0.006) are comparable to that of the Galaxy (Z = 0.014), and no evidence for the dominance of the binary channel at low Z could be identified observationally. Here, we explain this apparent contradiction by considering the minimum initial mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) needed for the stripped product to appear as a WR star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: By constraining M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), we estimate the importance of binaries in forming WR stars as a function of Z. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We calibrated M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} using the lowest-luminosity WR stars in the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. A range of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} values were explored using various evolution codes. We estimated the additional contribution of the binary channel by considering the interval [M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z)], which characterizes the initial-mass range in which the binary channel can form additional WR stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The WR-phenomenon ceases below luminosities of log L ? 4.9, 5.25, and 5.6 [L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}] in the Galaxy, the LMC, and the SMC, respectively, which translates to minimum He-star masses of 7.5, 11, 17 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and minimum initial masses of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} = 18, 23, 37 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Stripped stars with lower initial masses in the respective galaxies would tend not to appear as WR stars. The minimum mass necessary for self-stripping, M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), is strongly model-dependent, but it lies in the range 20-30, 30-60, and ?40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC, respectively. We find that that the additional contribution of the binary channel is a non-trivial and model-dependent function of Z that cannot be conclusively claimed to be monotonically increasing with decreasing Z. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The WR spectral appearance arises from the presence of strong winds. Therefore, both M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} increase with decreasing metallicity. Considering this, we show that one should not a-priori expect that binary interactions become increasingly important in forming WR stars at low Z, or that the WR binary fraction grows with decreasing Z.},

Further evolution was not computed, but we anticipate that it should follow the case B of Kippenhahn and Weigert (1967). Thus, after a somewhat slower exchange of additional 2-3 M\_odot the primary (now the less massive component should settle down near the main sequence for the helium burning stars. We identify this star with the Wolf-Rayet component of known massive binaries. The range of initial conditions that will lead to this type of evolution is discussed.

A sample evolutionary calculation for a 60M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_ star, incorporating recent theoretical results about violent pulsational instabilities in very massive stars, is critically compared with a multitude of observational facts. The relation between those pulsational instabilities and observed line profile variability in O stars is discussed. New wind models for PCygni are computed, with particular emphasis on the determination of its mass and surface He/H-ratio. A detailed comparison of our sequence with the Galactic WR population is performed, considering newly determined surface abundances. Our results suggest a new interpretation of luminous hydrogen-rich late-type WN stars as core hydrogen burning objects, while hot WN stars with small or zero hydrogen abundance are core helium burning stars. PCygni is identified with the hydrogen shell burning phase of our sequence. The observed upper luminosity limit for Galactic hydrogen-free WN stars appears to be consistent with our picture. Hence we propose the following evolutionary sequence for very massive stars: O -\&gt; Of -\&gt; H-rich WN -\&gt; LBV -\&gt; H-poor WN -\&gt; H-free WN -\&gt; WC -\&gt; SN.},

	abstract = {We suggest that the mass lost during the evolution of very massive stars may be dominated by optically thick, continuum-driven outbursts or explosions, instead of by steady line-driven winds. In order for a massive star to become a Wolf-Rayet star, it must shed its hydrogen envelope, but new estimates of the effects of clumping in winds from O-type stars indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss massive stars above roughly 40-50 Msolar, which do not become red supergiants and for which the best alternative is mass loss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest example of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of $\eta$ Carinae, when the star shed 12-20 Msolar or more in less than a decade. Other examples are circumstellar nebulae of LBVs and LBV candidates, extragalactic $\eta$ Car analogs (the so-called supernova impostors), and massive shells around supernovae and gamma-ray bursters. We do not yet fully understand what triggers LBV outbursts or what supplies their energy, but they occur nonetheless, and they present a fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals becomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a continuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are insensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a pivotal role in the evolution and ultimate fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early universe. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would also profoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early supernovae and hypernovae thought to be the origin of long gamma-ray bursts.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary calculations of massive single stars and of massive close binaries that we use in the population number synthesis (PNS) code are presented. Special attention is given to the assumptions/uncertainties influencing these stellar evolutionary computations (and thus the PNS results). A description is given of the PNS model together with the initial statistical distributions of stellar parameters needed to perform number synthesis. We focus on the population of O-type stars and WR stars in regions where star formation was continuous in time and in starburst regions. We discuss the observations that have to be explained by the model. These observations are then compared to the PNS predictions. We conclude that: probably the majority of the massive stars are formed as binary components with orbital period between 1 day and 10 yr; most of them interact. at most 8\% of the O-type stars are runaways due to a previous supernova explosion in a binary; recent studies of pulsar space velocities and linking the latter to the effect of asymmetrical supernova explosions, reveal that only a small percentage of these runaways will have a neutron star companion. with present day stellar evolutionary computations, it is difficult to explain the observed WR/O number ratio in the solar neighbourhood and in the inner Milky Way by assuming a constant star formation rate, with or without binaries. The observed ratio for the Magellanic Clouds is better reproduced. the majority of the single WR stars may have had a binary past. probably merely 2-3\% (and certainly less than 8\%) of all WR stars have a neutron star companion. a comparison between theoretical prediction and observations of young starbursts is meaningful only if binaries and the effect of binary evolution are correctly included. The most stringent feature is the rejuvenation caused by mass transfer.},

	abstract = {Context. Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars dominate the radiative and mechanical energy budget of galaxies and probe a critical phase in the evolution of massive stars prior to core collapse. It is not known whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR; cWR) form predominantly through wind stripping (w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). Whereas spectroscopy of WR binaries has so-far largely been avoided because of its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries and binary candidates of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; metallicity Z ? 0.5 Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), which were identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite spectra, or high X-ray luminosities. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive stars at subsolar metallicity and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming these stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Spectroscopy was performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement was performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status was interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically homogeneous evolution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Among our sample, 28/44 objects show composite spectra and are analyzed as such. An additional five targets show periodically moving WR primaries but no detected companions (SB1); two (BAT99 99 and 112) are potential WR + compact-object candidates owing to their high X-ray luminosities. We cannot confirm the binary nature of the remaining 11 candidates. About two-thirds of the WN components in binaries are identified as cWR, and one-third as hydrogen-burning WR stars. We establish metallicity-dependent mass-loss recipes, which broadly agree with those recently derived for single WN stars, and in which so-called WN3/O3 stars are clear outliers. We estimate that 45 {\textpm} 30\% of the cWR stars in our sample have interacted with a companion via mass transfer. However, only ?12 {\textpm} 7\% of the cWR stars in our sample naively appear to have formed purely owing to stripping via a companion (12\% b-WR). Assuming that apparently single WR stars truly formed as single stars, this comprises ?4\% of the whole LMC WN population, which is about ten times less than expected. No obvious differences in the properties of single and binary WN stars, whose luminosities extend down to log L ? 5.2 [L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}], are apparent. With the exception of a few systems (BAT99 19, 49, and 103), the equatorial rotational velocities of the OB-type companions are moderate (v{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ? 250 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and challenge standard formalisms of angular-momentum accretion. For most objects, chemically homogeneous evolution can be rejected for the secondary, but not for the WR progenitor. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.},

Although it is derived that the exponent of the mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z, one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures. Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines. Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance. A computer routine to calculate mass loss is publicly available.},

We find that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars are dominated by iron lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar to that of massive OB stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind strength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend on the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black hole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies. A further finding of our study is that the Z dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker at metallicities below Z/Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ? 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once the metal abundance drops below (Z/Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) ? 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. This is the result of an increased importance of radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such as carbon. In combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington limit - likely to be relevant for massive Population iii stars - this effect may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of these objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in enriching the intergalactic medium of the early Universe.},

	abstract = {Context. Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have a severe impact on their environments owing to their strong ionizing radiation fields and powerful stellar winds. Since these winds are considered to be driven by radiation pressure, it is theoretically expected that the degree of the wind mass-loss depends on the initial metallicity of WR stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the Milky Way, M 31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates for all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC. Based on these data, we discuss the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the mass loss and evolution of WR stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical properties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to multi-band observations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen abundance is detectable.

A metallicity effect on the evolution of massive stars is obvious from the HRD positions of the SMC WN stars at high temperatures and high luminosities.

	abstract = {We discuss all the relevant data, masses, luminosities, T\_eff\_, abundances, lifetimes, number ratios WR/O and WC/WN for Wolf-Rayet (WR) star models computed recently by the Geneva group. The results presented may be used directly as input data for population syntheses. The effects of enhanced mass loss rates during the main sequence and the WNL phases on the main outputs of the stellar models are studied in details. For a given metallicity, we find that models with high mass loss predict lower values for the minimum luminosity of the WR stars, lower C/He and O/He ratios at the entrance in the WC phase, and higher values of the WR/O and WC/WN number ratios when integrated over the mass spectrum. Most interestingly, we find that the ratio WC/WN is not a monotonic function of metallicity; these models predict a decrease of the ratio WC/WN for metallicities Z\&gt;=0.02 and enhanced mass loss rates. This is due to a long WNL phase obtained in models with high mass loss rates. The comparison of models and WR observations in the Milky Way shows that the mass loss rates during evolutionary phases before the WR stage are likely stronger than generally thought. We also examine the effects of binary mass transfer on the WR/O number ratios at various Z and on the way the WR are distributed among the different WR-subtypes (WNL, WNE and WC). The observed number ratios WR/O and WC/WR in nearby galaxies are particularly well accounted for. We find that at low Z values, nearly 100\% of the existing WR stars may owe their existence to binary mass transfer, while this percentage might be relatively low in inner galactic regions, where stellar winds are the dominant factor for forming WR stars and produce a lot of them. The above results are compatible with the fact that a relatively small fraction ({\textasciitilde}5\%) of O-stars have an evolution heavily influenced by binary mass transfer.},

Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss{\textemdash}are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.},

	abstract = {The effects of rotation on stellar evolution are particularly important at low metallicity, when mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and the surface enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes relatively more pronounced than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial masses (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ini{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) between 1.7 and 120 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and Z = 0.0004 (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected. Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly, due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ini{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 4 - 6 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are beyond the core helium burning phase and spend little time in the instability strip.

Massive stars with extreme rotation may skip the LBV phase. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Models having a typical v for the O-type stars have WR lifetimes on the average two times longer than for non-rotating models. The increase of the WR lifetimes is mainly due to that of the H-rich eWNL phase. Rotation allows a transition WN/WC phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60 M\_sun. The durations of the other WR subphases are less affected by rotation. The mass threshold for forming WR stars is lowered from 37 to 22 M\_sun for typical rotation. The comparisons of the predicted number ratios WR/O, WN/WC and of the number of transition WN/WC stars show very good agreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models with the present-day mass loss rates and no rotation. As to the chemical abundances in WR stars, rotation brings only very small changes for WN stars, since they have equilibrium CNO values. However, WC stars with rotation have on average lower C/He and O/He ratios. The luminosity distribution of WC stars is also influenced by rotation.},

	abstract = {Grids of models of massive stars (M >= 20 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) with rotation are computed for metallicities Z ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most massive O-stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial Z value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase. Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities (\&lt;50 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more chance to reach the break-up limit. The properties of the WR populations as predicted by the rotating models are in general in much better agreement with the observations in nearby galaxies. Some possible remaining difficulties in these comparisons are mentioned. The evolution of the chemical abundances is largely influenced by rotation in all phases from the MS phase to the WN and WC phases. We also show that the interval of initial masses going through the LBV stage is changing with Z and $\Omega$. The observed variation with metallicity of the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as found by Prantzos \&amp; Boissier ({\textbackslash}cite\{Pr03\}) is very well reproduced by the rotating models, while non-rotating models predict much too low ratios. This indicates that the minimum initial masses of single stars going through a WR phase are consistently predicted. At Z = 0.040, stars with initial masses above 50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} reach a final mass at the time of supernova explosion between 5 and 7.5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, while at Z = 0.004, like in the SMC, the final masses of stars are in the range of 17-29 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. On the whole, rotation appears to be an essential parameter even for the WR properties. Detailed tables describing the evolutionary tracks are available on the web.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive spectral analyses of the Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars of the nitrogen sequence (i.e. the WN subclass) have been performed in a previous paper. However, the distances of these objects were poorly known. Distances have a direct impact on the "absolute" parameters, such as luminosities and mass-loss rates. The recent Gaia Data Release (DR2) of trigonometric parallaxes includes nearly all WN stars of our Galactic sample. In the present paper, we apply the new distances to the previously analyzed Galactic WN stars and rescale the results accordingly. On this basis, we present a revised catalog of 55 Galactic WN stars with their stellar and wind parameters. The correlations between mass-loss rate and luminosity show a large scatter, for the hydrogen-free WN stars as well as for those with detectable hydrogen. The slopes of the log L - log {\.M} correlations are shallower than found previously. The empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) still shows the previously established dichotomy between the hydrogen-free early WN subtypes that are located on the hot side of the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and the late WN subtypes, which show hydrogen and reside mostly at cooler temperatures than the ZAMS (with few exceptions). However, with the new distances, the distribution of stellar luminosities became more continuous than obtained previously. The hydrogen-showing stars of late WN subtype are still found to be typically more luminous than the hydrogen-free early subtypes, but there is a range of luminosities where both subclasses overlap. The empirical HRD of the Galactic single WN stars is compared with recent evolutionary tracks. Neither these single-star evolutionary models nor binary scenarios can provide a fully satisfactory explanation for the parameters of these objects and their location in the HRD.},

	abstract = {Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine a previously studied sample of WC stars to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral analyzes remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities ranging from logL/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 4.9-6.0 with one outlier (WR 119) having logL/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging between log {\.M} = -5.1 and -4.1, with {\.M} ? L{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}0.68{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and a linear scaling of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.},

	abstract = {A nearly complete sample of 24 Magellanic Cloud WC/WO subclass Wolf-Rayet stars is studied spectroscopically and photometrically to determine its binary frequency. Theory predicts the Roche lobe overflow produced Wolf-Rayet binary frequency to be 52+/-14 per cent in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 100 per cent in the Small Magellanic Cloud, not counting non-Roche lobe overflow Wolf-Rayet binaries. Lower ambient metallicity (Z) leads to lower opacity, preventing all but the most massive (hence luminous) single stars from reaching the Wolf-Rayet stage. However, theory predicts that Roche lobe overflow even in binaries of modest mass will lead to Wolf-Rayet stars in binaries with periods below approximately 200d, for initial periods below approximately 1000d, independent of Z. By examining their absolute continuum magnitudes, radial velocity variations, emission-line equivalent widths and full widths at half-maximum, a WC/WO binary frequency of only 13 per cent, significantly lower than the prediction, is found in the Large Magellanic Cloud. In the unlikely event that all of the cases with a less certain binary status actually turn out to be binary, current theory and observation would agree. (The Small Magellanic Cloud contains only one WC/WO star, which happens to be a binary.) The three WC+O binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud all have periods well below 1000d. The large majority of WC/WO stars in such environments apparently can form without the aid of a binary companion. Current evolutionary scenarios appear to have difficulty explaining either the relatively large number of Wolf-Rayet stars in the Magellanic Clouds, or the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars in general.},

With this large sample, we discuss the global properties of the WNE population, which is expected to be the most sensitive to binary evolution with respect to the influence of metallicity. To emphasize the relevance of the binary frequency test for the stellar evolution of massive stars in the LMC, we review their observational properties and provide new and meaningful evolutionary classes, which reconcile observational and theoretical definitions.

This survey concludes the decade-long effort of the Montr{\'e}al Massive Star Group to monitor every known WR star in the Magellanic Clouds except for the six crowded WNL stars in R136, which will be discussed elsewhere. The focus of our survey was to monitor the so-called WNL stars for radial velocity (RV) variability in order to identify the short- to intermediate-period (P {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 200 d) binaries among them. Our results are in line with results of previous studies of other WR subtypes, and show that the binary frequency among LMC WNL stars is statistically consistent with that of WNL stars in the Milky Way. We have identified four previously unknown binaries, bringing the total number of known WNL binaries in the LMC to nine. Since it is very likely that none but one of the binaries is classical, helium-burning WNL star, but rather superluminous, hence extremely massive, hydrogen-burning object, our study has dramatically increased the number of known binaries harbouring such objects, and thus paved the way to determine their masses through model-independent, Keplerian orbits. It is expected that some of the stars in our binaries will be among the most massive known. With the binary status of each WR star now known, we also studied the photometric and X-ray properties of our program stars using archival MACHO photometry as well as Chandra and ROSAT data. We find that one of our presumably single WNL stars is among the X-ray brightest WR sources known. We also identify a binary candidate from its RV variability and X-ray luminosity which harbours the most luminous WR star known in the Local Group.},

	abstract = {Massive star evolutionary models generally predict the correct ratio of WC-type and WN-type Wolf-Rayet stars at low metallicities, but underestimate the ratio at higher (solar and above) metallicities. One possible explanation for this failure is perhaps single-star models are not sufficient and Roche-lobe overflow in close binaries is necessary to produce the "extra" WC stars at higher metallicities. However, this would require the frequency of close massive binaries to be metallicity dependent. Here we test this hypothesis by searching for close Wolf-Rayet binaries in the high metallicity environments of M31 and the center of M33 as well as in the lower metallicity environments of the middle and outer regions of M33. After identifying {\textasciitilde}100 Wolf-Rayet binaries based on radial velocity variations, we conclude that the close binary frequency of Wolf-Rayets is not metallicity dependent and thus other factors must be responsible for the overabundance of WC stars at high metallicities. However, our initial identifications and observations of these close binaries have already been put to good use as we are currently observing additional epochs for eventual orbit and mass determinations. The spectroscopic observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution. MMT telescope time was granted by NOAO, through the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP). TSIP is funded by the National Science Foundation.

For the systems with 16M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_ primaries the parameter space of initial mass ratio and orbital period is explored for the formation of contact binaries. It is found that systems with initial mass ratios q\_0\_\&lt;{\textasciitilde}0.7 evolve into contact during the first, rapid mass transfer phase, while systems with larger q\_0\_ but initial orbital period P\_0\_\&lt;{\textasciitilde}1.6d reach contact later on, during the slow mass transfer phase. For the wider case A systems that avoid contact altogether, there is a limited range in initial orbital period and mass ratio where it is possible that the original secondary star reaches the end of its evolution before the primary. In particular, in massive systems the secondary may undergo a supernova explosion before the primary, leading to the ejection of this primary (a helium star) from the system. We suggest that this type of evolution may be relevant to the formation of the Crab nebula, which is helium-rich and rather far from the Galactic plane. For case B systems we find that systems with larger orbital period are more likely to come into contact, even if the primary still has a radiative envelope.},
