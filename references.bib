abstract="The observed properties of Wolf-Rayet stars and relativistic objects in close binary systems are analyzed. The final masses MCOffor the carbon-oxygen cores of WR stars in WR + O binaries are calculated taking into account the radial loss of matter via stellar wind, which depends on the mass of the star. The analysis includes new data on the clumpy structure of WR winds, which appreciably decreases the required mass-loss rates {\$}{\$}{\backslash}dot M{\_}{\{}WR{\}}{\$}{\$}for the WR stars. The masses MCOflie in the range (1--2)M⊙--(20--44)M⊙ and have a continuous distribution. The masses of the relativistic objects Mxare 1--20M⊙ and have a bimodal distribution: the mean masses for neutron stars and black holes are 1.35 {\textpm} 0.15M⊙ and 8--10M⊙, respectively, with a gap from 2--4M⊙ in which no neutron stars or black holes are observed in close binaries. The mean final CO-core mass is {\$}{\$}{\backslash}overline M {\_}{\{}CO{\}}^f  = 7.4 - 10.3M{\_} {\backslash}odot{\$}{\$}, close to the mean mass for the black holes. This suggests that it is not only the mass of the progenitor that determines the nature of the relativistic object, but other parameters as well-rotation, magnetic field, etc. One SB1R Wolf-Rayet binary and 11 suspected WR + C binaries that may have low-mass companions (main-sequence or subgiant M-A stars) are identified; these could be the progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries with neutron stars and black holes.",

abstract="We present an overview of recent X-ray observations of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with XMM-Newton and Chandra. These observations are aimed at determining the differences in X-ray properties between massive WR + OB binary systems and putatively single WR stars. A new XMM spectrum of the nearby WN8 + OB binary WR 147 shows hard absorbed X-ray emission (including the Fe K$\alpha$ line complex), characteristic of colliding wind shock sources. In contrast, sensitive observations of four of the closest known single WC (carbon-rich) WR stars have yielded only non-detections. These results tentatively suggest that single WC stars are X-ray quiet. The presence of a companion may thus be an essential factor in elevating the X-ray emission of WC + OB stars to detectable levels.",

title={Evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars in binary systems: An analysis of the mass and orbital-eccentricity distributions},
journal={Astronomy Reports},
year={2003},
volume={47},
number={1},
pages={38-58},
abstract={We have undertaken a statistical study of the component mass ratios and the orbital eccentricities of WR + O close binary, detached main-sequence (DMS), contact early-type (CE), and semidetached (SD) systems. A comparison of the characteristics of WR + O systems and of DMS, CE, and SD systems has enabled us to draw certain conclusions about the evolutionary paths of WR + O binaries and to demonstrate that up to 90\% of all known WR + O binaries formed as a result of mass transfer in massive close O + O binary systems. Since there is a clear correlation between the component masses in SD systems with subgiants, the absence of an anticorrelation between the masses of the WR stars and O stars in WR + O binaries cannot be considered evidence against the formation of WR + O binaries via mass transfer. The spectroscopic transitional orbital period Ptrspcorresponding to the transition from nearly circular orbits (esp<0.1) to elliptical orbits (esp>=0.1) is {\textasciitilde}14d for WR + O systems and {\textasciitilde}2d-3d for OB + OB systems. The period range in which all WR + O orbits are circular \$\$(1{\backslash}mathop d{\backslash}limits\_. 6 {\backslash}leqslant P {\backslash}leqslant 14^d )\$\$is close to the range for SD systems with subgiants, \$\$0{\backslash}mathop d{\backslash}limits\_. 7 {\backslash}leqslant P {\backslash}leqslant 15^d \$\$. The large difference between the Ptrspvalues for WR + O and OB + OB systems suggests that a mechanism of orbit circularization additional to that for OB + OB systems at the DMS stage (tidal dissipation of the orbital energy due to radiative damping of the dynamical tides) acts in WR + O binaries. It is natural to suggest mass transfer in the parent O + O binaries as this supplementary orbit-circularization mechanism. Since the transitional period between circular and elliptical orbits for close binaries with convective envelopes and ages of 5{\texttimes}109 years is \$\$P\_\{tr\}  = 12{\backslash}mathop d{\backslash}limits\_. 4\$\$, the orbits of most known SD systems with subgiants had enough time to circularize during the DMS stage, prior to the mass transfer. Thus, for most SD systems, mass transfer plays a secondary role in circularization of their orbits.},

Refined near-infrared (YHJK) classification criteria based on over a hundred Galactic and Magellanic Cloud WR stars, providing diagnostics for hydrogen in WN stars, plus the identification of WO stars and intermediate WN/C stars. Finally, we find that only a quarter of WR stars in the survey region are associated with star clusters and/or H II regions, with similar statistics found for luminous blue variables (LBVs) in the Milky Way.

Candidates were selected by their near-infrared (Two Micron All Sky Survey; 2MASS) and mid-infrared (Spitzer/GLIMPSE) color excesses, which are consistent with free-free emission from ionized stellar winds and thermal excess from hot dust. We have confirmed 12 new Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galactic disk, including nine of the nitrogen subtype (WN), and three of the carbon subtype (WC); this raises the total number of Wolf-Rayet stars discovered with our approach to 27. We classify one of the new stars as a possible dust-producing WC9d + OBI colliding-wind binary, as evidenced by an infrared excess resembling that of known WC9d stars, the detection of OBI features superimposed on the WC9 spectrum, and hard X-ray emission detected by XMM-Newton. A WC8 star in our sample appears to be a member of the stellar cluster Danks 1, in contrast to the rest of the confirmed Wolf-Rayet stars that generally do not appear to reside within dense stellar clusters. Either the majority of the stars are runaways from clusters, or they formed in relative isolation.

	abstract = {We have spectroscopically identified 60 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, including 38 nitrogen types (WN) and 22 carbon types (WC). Using photometry from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE and Two Micron All Sky Survey databases, the new WRs were selected via a method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors, which is mainly the result of excess radiation generated by free-free scattering within their dense ionized winds. The selection criterion has been refined since the last report, resulting in a WR detection rate of ?20\% in spectroscopic follow-up of candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution of all known WRs having B {\textgreater} 14 mag. However, there are smaller regions within this color space that yield WRs at a rate of {\textgreater}50\% in spectroscopic follow-up. Candidates that are not WRs are mainly Be stars, which is possibly attributable to the physical similarities between the free-free emission parameters of Be disks and WR winds. As an additional selection experiment, the list of WR candidates was cross-correlated with archival X-ray point-source catalogs, which increases the WR detection rate of the broad color space to ?40\% 10 new WR X-ray sources have been found in addition to a previously unrecognized X-ray counterpart to a known WR. The extinction values, distances, and Galactocentric radii of all new WRs are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Although the majority of the new WRs have no obvious association with stellar clusters, two WC8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive-star cluster, in which five OB supergiants were also identified. The new system lies at an estimated distance of ?6.1 kpc, near the intersection of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm with the Galaxy's bar. In addition, two WC and four WN stars, all but one of which are X-ray sources, were identified in association with the stellar clusters Danks 1 and 2. A WN9 star has also been associated with the cluster [DBS2003] 179. This work brings the total number of known Galactic WRs to 476, or ?7\%-8\% of the total empirically estimated population. An examination of their Galactic distribution reveals an approximate tracing of the spiral arms and an enhanced WR surface density toward several massive-star formation sites.},

Using a sample of spectrally classified objects, we find that WR stars are well distinguished from the field stellar population in the (W1 - W2) versus (J - Ks ) color-color diagram, and further distinguished from other emission line objects such as planetary nebulae, Be, and cataclysmic variable stars using a combination of NIR and MIR color constraints. As proof of concept we applied the color constraints to a photometric sample in the Galactic plane, located WR star candidates, and present five new spectrally confirmed and classified WC (1) and WN (4) stars. Analysis of the 0.8-5.0 $\mu$m spectral data for a subset of known, bright WC and WN stars shows that emission lines (primarily He I) extend into the 3.0-5.0 $\mu$m spectral region, although their strength is greatly diminished compared to the 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m region. The WR population stands out relative to background field stars at NIR and MIR colors due to an excess continuum contribution, likely caused by free-free scattering in dense winds. Mean photometric properties of known WRs are presented and imply that reddened late-type WN and WC sources are easier to detect than earlier-type sources at larger Galactic radii. WISE W3 and W4 images of 10 WR stars show evidence of circumstellar shells linked to mass ejections from strong stellar winds.},

	abstract = {Context. The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the science targets, therefore using precious observing time.  Aims: We present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based telescopes and instruments.  Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.  Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2\% of the continuum.  Conclusions: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation. The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption correction may improve future observational and analysing strategies, as well as empower users of archival data. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Molecfit is available at {\textless}A href="http://www.eso.org/pipelines/skytools"{\textgreater}http://www.eso.org/pipelines/skytools{\textless}/A{\textgreater}Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs: 60.A-9100, 60.A-9452, 076.C-0129, 075.A-0603, 079.D-0374, 080.D-0526, 290.C-5022, 092.D-0024, 084.D-0912, 085.D-0161, 086.D-0066, and 088.D-0109.},

	abstract = {Context. Absorption by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere strongly affects ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e. pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved. Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS) are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed without any additional calibration observations of TSS.  Aims: We evaluate the quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of archival ESO-VLT/X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra.  Methods: Thanks to the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles. These investigations are based on two figures of merit, I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}off{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}res{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, that describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction achieved with molecfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard star.  Results: The evaluation of the telluric correction with molecfit shows a convincing removal of atmospheric absorption features. The comparison with the classical method reveals that molecfit performs better because it is not prone to the bad continuum reconstruction, noise, and intrinsic spectral features introduced by the telluric standard star.  Conclusions: Fitted synthetic transmission spectra are an excellent alternative to the correction based on telluric standard stars. Moreover, molecfit offers wide flexibility for adaption to various instruments and observing sites. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/skytools/"{\textgreater}http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/skytools/{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

The high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring survey of O and WN stars (OWN Survey, Barb{\'a} et al. 2010) has completed seven years of sustained campaign, using observational facilities in Chile and Argentina. The selected sample corresponds to those stars for which there is no indication of multiplicity in the Galactic O-star Catalog (Ma{\'i}z Apell{\'a}niz et al. 2004) and the VII Catalogue of Galactic WR stars (van der Hucht 2001). We have collected almost 5000 spectra of about 240 O and WN stars. From that sample of 190 O-type stars, we have discovered 146 stars showing radial variations greater than 10 km/s, including 108 new systems, being 56 single-lined spectroscopic binaries, 43 double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and 9 multiple-lined binaries. The new orbital periods spanning from 1.5 to 2200 days. In this work, we present the main result of ``OWN Survey'': the determination of orbits for over fifty O-type spectroscopic binary systems, and the analysis of the spectral-type, luminosty, period, eccentricity, and mass-ratio distributions. This result is unprecedented in the context of massive binary stars, since we are almost doubling the number of Galactic O-type star systems with known orbits.},

	abstract = {Context. Massive binaries play a crucial role in the Universe. Knowing the distributions of their orbital parameters is important for a wide range of topics from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels and from the distribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet no direct measurements exist outside the Milky Way.  Aims: The Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring project was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial velocity (RV) monitoring of 102 massive binaries in the 30 Doradus region.  Methods: In this paper we analyze 32 FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier analysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single-lined (SB1) and 31 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries.  Results: Overall, the binary fraction and orbital properties across the 30 Doradus region are found to be similar to existing Galactic samples. This indicates that within these domains environmental effects are of second order in shaping the properties of massive binary systems. A small difference is found in the distribution of orbital periods, which is slightly flatter (in log space) in 30 Doradus than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible within error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, orbital periods in 30 Doradus can be as short as 1.1 d, somewhat shorter than seen in Galactic samples. Equal mass binaries (q\&gt; 0.95) in 30 Doradus are all found outside NGC 2070, the central association that surrounds R136a, the very young and massive cluster at 30 Doradus's core. Most of the differences, albeit small, are compatible with expectations from binary evolution. One outstanding exception, however, is the fact that earlier spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter orbital periods than later spectral types (O9.2-O9.7).  Conclusions: Our results point to a relative universality of the incidence rate of massive binaries and their orbital properties in the metallicity range from solar (Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) to about half solar. This provides the first direct constraints on massive binary properties in massive star-forming galaxies at the Universe's peak of star formation at redshifts z 1 to 2 which are estimated to have Z 0.5 Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The log of observations and RV measurements for all targets are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} ({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}http://130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/598/A84"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/598/A84{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {During the summer of 2013, a 4-month spectroscopic campaign took place to observe the variabilities in three Wolf-Rayet stars. The spectroscopic data have been analysed for WR 134 (WN6b), to better understand its behaviour and long-term periodicity, which we interpret as arising from corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the wind. By analysing the variability of the He II $\lambda$5411 emission line, the previously identified period was refined to P = 2.255 {\textpm} 0.008 (s.d.) d. The coherency time of the variability, which we associate with the lifetime of the CIRs in the wind, was deduced to be 40 {\textpm} 6 d, or \~{}18 cycles, by cross-correlating the variability patterns as a function of time. When comparing the phased observational grey-scale difference images with theoretical grey-scales previously calculated from models including CIRs in an optically thin stellar wind, we find that two CIRs were likely present. A separation in longitude of $\Delta$$\varphi$ ? 90{\textdegree} was determined between the two CIRs and we suggest that the different maximum velocities that they reach indicate that they emerge from different latitudes. We have also been able to detect observational signatures of the CIRs in other spectral lines (C IV $\lambda$$\lambda$5802,5812 and He I $\lambda$5876). Furthermore, a DAC was found to be present simultaneously with the CIR signatures detected in the He I $\lambda$5876 emission line which is consistent with the proposed geometry of the large-scale structures in the wind. Small-scale structures also show a presence in the wind, simultaneously with the larger scale structures, showing that they do in fact co-exist.},

	abstract = {Observations have suggested substantial departures from pressure equilibrium in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the plane of the Galaxy, even on scales under 50 pc. Nevertheless, multiphase models of the ISM assume at least locally isobaric gas. The pressure then determines the density reached by gas cooling to stable thermal equilibrium. We use numerical models of the magnetized ISM to examine the consequences of supernova driving for interstellar pressures. In this paper we examine a (200 pc)3 periodic domain threaded by magnetic fields. Individual parcels of gas at different pressures reach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set of phases is found but rather a dynamically determined continuum of densities and temperatures. A substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium. Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures. They also suggest that the high pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to ram pressures in addition to gravitational forces. Much of the gas in our model lies far from equipartition between thermal and magnetic pressures, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to 104 and ratios of uniform to fluctuating magnetic field of 0.5-1. Our models show broad pressure probability distribution functions with log-normal functional forms produced by both shocks and rarefaction waves rather than power-law distributions produced by isolated supernova remnants. The width of the distribution can be described quantitatively by a formula derived from the work of Padoan, Nordlund, \& Jones.},

In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

	abstract = {Observations show that at least some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) happen simultaneously with core-collapse supernovae (SNe), thus linking by a common thread nature's two grandest explosions. We review here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions (GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference.},

We then investigated the overall binary frequency of the sample and the orbital characteristics of the known binaries. Binaries are common among O stars in clusters and associations ({\textgreater}59\% have a visual or spectroscopic companion) but less so among field and especially runaway stars. There are many triple systems among the speckle binaries, and we discuss their possible role in the ejection of stars from clusters. The period distribution of the binaries is bimodal in log P, but we suggest that binaries with periods of years and decades may eventually be found to fill the gap. The mass ratio distribution of the visual binaries increases toward lower mass ratios, but low mass ratio companions are rare among close, spectroscopic binaries (probably because of the difficulty of spectroscopic detection rather than a real deficit). We present distributions of the eccentricity and longitude of periastron for spectroscopic binaries with elliptical orbits, and we find strong evidence of a bias in the longitude of periastron distribution (the ``Barr effect''), which is probably caused by line distortions introduced by circumstellar gas.},

The speckle observations were made with the Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m telescopes and USNO speckle camera, and they are sensitive to the detection of binaries in the angular separation regime between 0farcs03 and 5'' with relatively bright companions ($\Delta$V {\textless} 3). We report on the discovery of companions to 14 OB stars. In total we resolved companions of 41 of 385 O-stars (11\%), 4 of 37 Wolf-Rayet stars (11\%), and 89 of 139 B-stars (64\%; an enriched visual binary sample that we selected for future orbital determinations). We made a statistical analysis of the binary frequency among the subsample that are listed in the Galactic O Star Catalog by compiling published data on other visual companions detected through adaptive optics studies and/or noted in the Washington Double Star Catalog and by collecting published information on radial velocities and spectroscopic binaries. We find that the binary frequency is much higher among O-stars in clusters and associations compared to the numbers for field and runaway O-stars, consistent with predictions for the ejection processes for runaway stars. We present a first orbit for the O-star $\delta$ Orionis; a linear solution of the close, apparently optical, companion of the O-star $\iota$ Orionis; and an improved orbit of the Be star $\delta$ Scorpii. Finally, we list astrometric data for another 249 resolved and 221 unresolved targets that are lower mass stars that we observed for various other science programs.},

	abstract = {Context. The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is our closest view of a starburst region and is the ideal environment to investigate important questions regarding the formation, evolution and final fate of the most massive stars.  Aims: We analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive O-type star population observed through multi-epoch spectroscopy in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey. With 360 O-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample of massive stars analyzed to date.  Methods: We use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identify spectroscopic binaries. We also use a Monte-Carlo method to correct for observational biases. By modeling simultaneously the observed binary fraction, the distributions of the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations and the distribution of the time scales of these variations, we constrain the intrinsic current binary fraction and period and mass-ratio distributions.  Results: We observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35 {\textpm} 0.03, which corresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significant radial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We compute the intrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51 {\textpm} 0.04. We adopt power-laws to describe the intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f(log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d) {\textasciitilde} (log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}$\pi${\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (with log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}P/d in the range 0.15-3.5) and f(q) {\textasciitilde} q{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}$\kappa${\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} with 0.1 <= q = M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} <= 1.0. The power-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are $\pi$ = -0.45 {\textpm} 0.30 and $\kappa$ = -1.0 {\textpm} 0.4. The period distribution that we obtain thus favours shorter period systems compared to an {\"O}pik law ($\pi$ = 0). The mass ratio distribution is slightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with a random sampling of a classical mass function ($\kappa$ = -2.35). The binary fraction seems mostly uniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types and luminosity classes. The binary fraction in the outer region of the field of view (r \&gt; 7.8', i.e. ?117 pc) and among the O9.7 I/II objects are however significantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations. The observed and intrinsic binary fractions are also lower for the faintest objects in our sample (K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 15.5 mag), which results from observational effects and the fact that our O star sample is not magnitude-limited but is defined by a spectral-type cutoff. We also conclude that magnitude-limited investigations are biased towards larger binary fractions.  Conclusions: Using the multiplicity properties of the O stars in the Tarantula region and simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over 50\% of the current O star population will exchange mass with its companion within a binary system. This shows that binary interaction is greatly affecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken into account to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under program ID 182.D-0222.Full Tables 1-3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater}({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/550/A107"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/550/A107{\textless}/A{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Multiplicity is one of the most fundamental observable properties of massive O-type stars and offers a promising way to discriminate between massive star formation theories. Nevertheless, companions at separations between 1 and 100 milliarcsec (mas) remain mostly unknown due to intrinsic observational limitations. At a typical distance of 2 kpc, this corresponds to projected physical separations of 2-200 AU. The Southern MAssive Stars at High angular resolution survey (SMaSH+) was designed to fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey of Galactic massive stars. We observed 117 O-type stars with VLTI/PIONIER and 162 O-type stars with NACO/Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM), probing the separation ranges 1-45 and 30-250 mas and brightness contrasts of $\Delta$H {\textless} 4 and $\Delta$H {\textless} 5, respectively. Taking advantage of NACO's field of view, we further uniformly searched for visual companions in an 8'' radius down to $\Delta$H = 8. This paper describes observations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 new companions in the separation range from 1 mas to 8'' and presents a catalog of detections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen known long-period spectroscopic binaries. Excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96 objects in our main sample ($\delta$ {\textless} 0{\textdegree} H {\textless} 7.5) were observed both with PIONIER and NACO/SAM. The fraction of these stars with at least one resolved companion within 200 mas is 0.53. Accounting for known but unresolved spectroscopic or eclipsing companions, the multiplicity fraction at separation $\rho$ {\textless} 8'' increases to f m = 0.91 {\textpm} 0.03. The fraction of luminosity class V stars that have a bound companion reaches 100\% at 30 mas while their average number of physically connected companions within 8'' is f c = 2.2 {\textpm} 0.3. This demonstrates that massive stars form nearly exclusively in multiple systems. The nine non-thermal radio emitters observed by SMaSH+ are all resolved, including the newly discovered pairs HD 168112 and CPD-47{\textdegree}2963. This lends strong support to the universality of the wind-wind collision scenario to explain the non-thermal emission from O-type stars.},

Inflections in the cumulative distribution near 6 days, 14 days, and 45 days suggest key physical scales of sime0.2, sime0.4, and sime1 A.U. where yet-to-be-identified phenomena create distinct features. No single power law provides a statistically compelling prescription, but if features are ignored, a power law with exponent $\beta$ {\textasciitilde}= -0.22 provides a crude approximation over P = 1.4-2000 days, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45 days. The cumulative period distribution flattens at P {\textgreater} 45 days, even after correction for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or a shift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91\% likelihood) between the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests that the binary properties at P {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 25 days are determined by local physics of disk/clump fragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionary factors. Fully 30\% of the unbiased parent sample is a binary with period P {\textless} 45 days. Completeness corrections imply a binary fraction near 55\% for P {\textless} 5000 days. The observed distribution of mass ratios 0.2 {\textless} q {\textless} 1 is consistent with uniform, while the observed distribution of eccentricities 0.1 {\textless} e {\textless} 0.6 is consistent with uniform plus an excess of e {\textasciitilde}= 0 systems.

We also identify 11 new double-lined spectroscopic binaries, 6 of which are of O+O type and 5 of O+B type, and an additional new tripled-lined spectroscopic binary of O+O+B type. We also revise some of the previous GOSSS classifications, present some egregious examples of stars erroneously classified as O-type in the past, introduce the use of luminosity class IV at spectral types O4-O5.5, and adapt the classification scheme to the work of Arias et al. The GOSSS spectroscopic data in this article were gathered with five facilities: the 1.5 m Telescope at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN), the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), the 3.5 m Telescope at Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA), and the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) and 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) at Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM).},

	abstract = {Context. Multiplicity in massive stars is key to understanding the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. Among massive stars, those of O type play a crucial role due to their high masses and short lifetimes.  Aims: MONOS (Multiplicity Of Northern O-type Spectroscopic systems) is a project designed to collect information and study O-type spectroscopic binaries with $\delta$ \&gt; -20{\textdegree}. In this first paper we describe the sample and provide spectral classifications and additional information for objects with previous spectroscopic and/or eclipsing binary orbits. In future papers we will test the validity of previous solutions and calculate new spectroscopic orbits.  Methods: The spectra in this paper have two sources: the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), a project that obtains blue-violet R \~{} 2500 spectroscopy of thousands of massive stars, and LiLiMaRlin, a library of libraries of high-resolution spectroscopy of massive stars obtained from four different surveys (CAF{\'E}-BEANS, OWN, IACOB, and NoMaDS) and additional data from our own observing programs and public archives. We have also used lucky images obtained with AstraLux.  Results: We present homogeneous spectral classifications for 92 O-type spectroscopic multiple systems and ten optical companions, many of them original. We discuss the visual multiplicity of each system with the support of AstraLux images and additional sources. For eleven O-type objects and for six B-type objects we present their first GOSSS spectral classifications. For two known eclipsing binaries we detect double absorption lines (SB2) or a single moving line (SB1) for the first time, to which we add a third system reported by us recently. For two previous SB1 systems we detect their SB2 nature for the first time and give their first separate spectral classifications, something we have also done for a third object just recently identified as a SB2. We also detect nine new astrometric companions and provide updated information on several others. We emphasize the results for two stars: for $\sigma$ Ori AaAbB we provide spectral classifications for the three components with a single observation for the first time thanks to a lucky spectroscopy observation obtained close to the Aa,Ab periastron and for $\theta${\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Ori CaCb we add it to the class of Galactic Of?p stars, raising the number of its members to six. Our sample of O-type spectroscopic binaries contains more triple- or higher-order systems than double systems. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Table A.2 is also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/626/A20"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/626/A20{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. It is well known that massive O stars are frequently (if not always) found in binary or higher-order multiple systems, but this fact has been less robustly investigated for the lower mass range of the massive stars, represented by B-type stars. Obtaining the binary fraction and orbital parameter distributions of B-type stars is crucial to understand the impact of multiplicity on the archetypal progenitor of core-collapse supernovae as well as to properly investigate formation channels for gravitational wave progenitors.  Aims: This work aims to characterise the multiplicity of the B star population of the young open cluster NGC 6231 through multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of 80 B-type stars.  Methods: We analyse 31 FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations of 80 B-type stars, monitoring their radial velocities (RVs) and performing a least-squares spectral analysis (Lomb-Scargle) to search for periodicity in those stars with statistically significant variability in their RVs.  Results: We constrained an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of 33 {\textpm} 5\% for the B-type stars of NGC 6231, with a first order bias correction giving a true spectroscopic binary fraction of 52 {\textpm} 8\%. Out of 27 B-type binary candidates, we obtained orbital solutions for 20 systems: 15 single-lined (SB1) and five double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s). We present these orbital solutions and the orbital parameter distributions associated with them.  Conclusions: Our results indicate that Galactic B-type stars are less frequently found in binary systems than their more massive O-type counterparts, but their orbital properties generally resemble those of B- and O-type stars in both the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables C.1-C.5 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A69"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A69{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the ESO Paranal observatory under ESO program 099.D-0895 and 0101.D-0163.},

Intrinsic colours and absolute visual magnitudes per subtype are re-assessed for a re-determination of optical photometric distances and galactic distribution of WR stars. In the solar neighbourhood we find projected on the galactic plane a surface density of 3.3 WR stars per kpc 2, with a WC/WN number ratio of 1.5, and a WR binary frequency (including probable binaries) of 39\%. The galactocentric distance ( RWR) distribution per subtype shows overlineR WR increasing with decreasing WR subtype, both for the WN and WC subtypes. This overlineR WR distribution allows for the possibility of WNE→WCE and WNL→WCL subtype evolution.},

	abstract = {We have spectroscopically identified 60 Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, including 38 nitrogen types (WN) and 22 carbon types (WC). Using photometry from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE and Two Micron All Sky Survey databases, the new WRs were selected via a method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors, which is mainly the result of excess radiation generated by free-free scattering within their dense ionized winds. The selection criterion has been refined since the last report, resulting in a WR detection rate of ≈20\% in spectroscopic follow-up of candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution of all known WRs having B {\textgreater} 14 mag. However, there are smaller regions within this color space that yield WRs at a rate of {\textgreater}50\% in spectroscopic follow-up. Candidates that are not WRs are mainly Be stars, which is possibly attributable to the physical similarities between the free-free emission parameters of Be disks and WR winds. As an additional selection experiment, the list of WR candidates was cross-correlated with archival X-ray point-source catalogs, which increases the WR detection rate of the broad color space to ≈40\% 10 new WR X-ray sources have been found in addition to a previously unrecognized X-ray counterpart to a known WR. The extinction values, distances, and Galactocentric radii of all new WRs are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Although the majority of the new WRs have no obvious association with stellar clusters, two WC8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive-star cluster, in which five OB supergiants were also identified. The new system lies at an estimated distance of ≈6.1 kpc, near the intersection of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm with the Galaxy's bar. In addition, two WC and four WN stars, all but one of which are X-ray sources, were identified in association with the stellar clusters Danks 1 and 2. A WN9 star has also been associated with the cluster [DBS2003] 179. This work brings the total number of known Galactic WRs to 476, or ≈7\%-8\% of the total empirically estimated population. An examination of their Galactic distribution reveals an approximate tracing of the spiral arms and an enhanced WR surface density toward several massive-star formation sites.},

Application to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR stars generally lie in the thin disc (∼40 pc half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric radii 3.5-10 kpc, in accordance with other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR stars located at vertical distances of ≥300 pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting for close binary evolution are more consistent with observations. We consolidate information acquired about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build a simple model of the complete population. We derive observable quantities over a range of wavelengths, allowing us to estimate a total number of 1900 ± 250 Galactic WR stars, implying an average duration of ∼ 0.4 Myr for the WR phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate. Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use this model WR population to predict follow-up spectroscopy to KS ≃ 17.5 mag will be necessary to identify 95 per cent of Galactic WR stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will make few additional WR star discoveries via low-resolution spectroscopy, though will significantly refine existing distance determinations.

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	abstract = {We present spectrophotometry of the leading emission-line features for nearly all the Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These form the empirical basis of the normal relationships among the various lines. Emission lines have a wide range of strengths, but all lines in a given star are strong or weak together, aside from the well-understood ionization effects. We present the first extensive data of the N IV λ3480 feature in WN stars. This line persists to earlier types than does the singlet N IV λ4057 line, probably due to decreasing optical depth in the latter transition. Among those very few WN stars with anomalous lines, there are eight objects, mostly single stars, with inordinately strong C IV; we label them "WN/WC" and suggest that they have a "transition" composition between the WN and WC subclasses. We give quantitative descriptions of "early" (WNE; WCE) and "late" (WNL; WCL) types for the WN and WC classes, respectively. Among WC stars, the persistence of the C III λ4650 feature to the earliest subtypes (where C III λ5696 has already disappeared) suggests the importance of the contribution of C IV λ4658 to the blend, or an anomalous triplet-singlet behavior in the C III ions similar to that observed in N IV in the WN sequence. We compare the emission-line fluxes of He II λ4686 with the M\_v\_ for the WN stars of the LMC. Aside from the ionization effects, there is a nice correlation of these parameters since brighter stars have more continuum flux present at 4686 A. Although WCL stars have not been found in the LMC, the line strengths of the other W-R stars are very similar in that system and in our own Galaxy.},

Our quantitative spectroscopic analysis uses ultraviolet (IUE), optical (AAT, Mt. Stromlo) and infrared (UKIRT, CTIO) spectroscopy and is based on model atmospheres obtained with the iterative scheme of Hillier (1990A\&amp;A...231..116H). Stellar properties for all three stars are quite similar: log L\_*\_/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_={\textasciitilde}5.8, R\_*\_/R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_={\textasciitilde}35, -4.9\&lt;=log˙(M)/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_/yr\&lt;=-4.5, 955\&lt;=v{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}infinity{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_\&lt;=1445km/s. Spectroscopic mass-loss rates are in excellent agreement with radio methods and are more representative of late WN (WNL) stars than O-type supergiants. From this comparison we find that the O and WNL spectral classifications are distinguished principally by surface mass flux (˙(M)/4πR\_*\_{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}), with stellar temperature and surface helium content secondary effects. Since surface chemical abundances do not necessarily define the core energy production mechanism - a commonly used distinction between O and WR types - we argue caution when comparing observed O:WNL ratios with theoretical predictions and inferring stellar evolution in various galaxies. The increasing helium content of the programme stars - O8Iaf (y=N(He)/[N(H)+N(He)]=0.20), O8:Iafpe (y=0.40) and WN9ha (y=0.45) - is strongly indicative of a direct evolutionary connection from O8If=\&gt;WN9ha without passage through an intermediate Luminous Blue Variable phase, contrary to current evolutionary theory, and suggestive of additional processes (e.g. rotation) bringing processed material to the surface. The high helium content of HD 151804 confirms previous findings that Of stars are helium enriched by core processed material.},

The differences in the intrinsic colors of W-R stars from subtype to subtype is small compared to the considerable variation present among stars of the same subtype. Despite the improved accuracy in determining the continuum colors, reddening-free indices still show scatter far in excess of the observational uncertainties, particularly at shorter wavelengths.},

A major problem in those model calculations is to establish the temperature stratification from the condition of radiative equilibrium. Dealing with non-LTE models for spherically expanding atmospheres of Wolf-Rayet stars, we developed a new temperature correction method. Its basic idea dates back to 1955 when it was proposed by Unsöld for grey, static and plane-parallel atmospheres in LTE. The equations were later generalized to the non-grey case by Lucy. In the present paper we furthermore drop the Eddington approximation, proceed to spherical geometry and allow for expansion of the atmosphere. Finally the concept of an ``approximate lambda operator'' is employed to speed up the convergence. Tests for Wolf-Rayet type models demonstrate that the method works fine even in situations of strong non-LTE.},

My primary goal is to review the evidence supporting the idea that Galactic extinction curves can be considered a 1-parameter family characterized by their value of RV ≡ AV/E(B-V). Based on analysis of new (i.e., 2MASS) and old (i.e., IUE) data for ∼100 sightlines, I show that the UV, optical, and IR wavelength regimes do display coherent variations, but with too much intrinsic scatter to be considered truly correlated. A 1-parameter family can be constructed which illustrates these broad trends, but very few individual sightlines are actually well-reproduced by such a family and disagreement with the mean trends is not a sufficient condition for ``peculiarity.'' Only a very small number of extinction sightlines stand out as truly peculiar. It is likely that simple variations in the mean grain size from sightline to sightline are responsible for much of the coherent variability seen in Galactic extinction, and might also explain the ``peculiar'' extinction long-noted in the Magellanic Clouds.},

We find that the rotation velocities v of WR stars are modest, i.e. about 50 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, not very dependent on the initial v and masses. For the most massive stars, the evolution of v is very strongly influenced by the values of the mass loss rates; below {\textasciitilde} 12 M\_sun the evolution of rotation during the MS phase and later phases is dominated by the internal coupling. Massive stars with extreme rotation may skip the LBV phase. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Models having a typical v for the O-type stars have WR lifetimes on the average two times longer than for non-rotating models. The increase of the WR lifetimes is mainly due to that of the H-rich eWNL phase. Rotation allows a transition WN/WC phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60 M\_sun. The durations of the other WR subphases are less affected by rotation. The mass threshold for forming WR stars is lowered from 37 to 22 M\_sun for typical rotation. The comparisons of the predicted number ratios WR/O, WN/WC and of the number of transition WN/WC stars show very good agreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models with the present-day mass loss rates and no rotation. As to the chemical abundances in WR stars, rotation brings only very small changes for WN stars, since they have equilibrium CNO values. However, WC stars with rotation have on average lower C/He and O/He ratios. The luminosity distribution of WC stars is also influenced by rotation.},

Special attention is given to the assumptions/uncertainties influencing these stellar evolutionary computations (and thus the PNS results). A description is given of the PNS model together with the initial statistical distributions of stellar parameters needed to perform number synthesis. We focus on the population of O-type stars and WR stars in regions where star formation was continuous in time and in starburst regions. We discuss the observations that have to be explained by the model. These observations are then compared to the PNS predictions. We conclude that: probably the majority of the massive stars are formed as binary components with orbital period between 1 day and 10 yr; most of them interact. at most 8\% of the O-type stars are runaways due to a previous supernova explosion in a binary; recent studies of pulsar space velocities and linking the latter to the effect of asymmetrical supernova explosions, reveal that only a small percentage of these runaways will have a neutron star companion. with present day stellar evolutionary computations, it is difficult to explain the observed WR/O number ratio in the solar neighbourhood and in the inner Milky Way by assuming a constant star formation rate, with or without binaries. The observed ratio for the Magellanic Clouds is better reproduced. the majority of the single WR stars may have had a binary past. probably merely 2-3\% (and certainly less than 8\%) of all WR stars have a neutron star companion. a comparison between theoretical prediction and observations of young starbursts is meaningful only if binaries and the effect of binary evolution are correctly included. The most stringent feature is the rejuvenation caused by mass transfer.},

Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are evolved massive stars (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}I{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≳ 20 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) characterized by strong mass-loss. Hypothetically, they can form either as single stars or as mass donors in close binaries. About 40\% of all known WR stars are confirmed binaries, raising the question as to the impact of binarity on the WR population. Studying WR binaries is crucial in this context, and furthermore enable one to reliably derive the elusive masses of their components, making them indispensable for the study of massive stars.  Aims: By performing a spectral analysis of all multiple WR systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), we obtain the full set of stellar parameters for each individual component. Mass-luminosity relations are tested, and the importance of the binary evolution channel is assessed.  Methods: The spectral analysis is performed with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra that correspond to each component. Evolutionary channels are constrained using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) evolution tool.  Results: Significant hydrogen mass fractions (0.1 \&lt;X{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.4) are detected in all WN components. A comparison with mass-luminosity relations and evolutionary tracks implies that the majority of the WR stars in our sample are not chemically homogeneous. The WR component in the binary AB 6 is found to be very luminous (log L ≈ 6.3 [L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}]) given its orbital mass (≈10 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), presumably because of observational contamination by a third component. Evolutionary paths derived for our objects suggest that Roche lobe overflow had occurred in most systems, affecting their evolution. However, the implied initial masses (≳60 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) are large enough for the primaries to have entered the WR phase, regardless of binary interaction.  Conclusions: Together with the results for the putatively single SMC WR stars, our study suggests that the binary evolution channel does not dominate the formation of WR stars at SMC metallicity.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive spectral analyses of the Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars of the nitrogen sequence (i.e. the WN subclass) have been performed in a previous paper. However, the distances of these objects were poorly known. Distances have a direct impact on the "absolute" parameters, such as luminosities and mass-loss rates. The recent Gaia Data Release (DR2) of trigonometric parallaxes includes nearly all WN stars of our Galactic sample. In the present paper, we apply the new distances to the previously analyzed Galactic WN stars and rescale the results accordingly. On this basis, we present a revised catalog of 55 Galactic WN stars with their stellar and wind parameters. The correlations between mass-loss rate and luminosity show a large scatter, for the hydrogen-free WN stars as well as for those with detectable hydrogen. The slopes of the log L - log Ṁ correlations are shallower than found previously. The empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) still shows the previously established dichotomy between the hydrogen-free early WN subtypes that are located on the hot side of the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and the late WN subtypes, which show hydrogen and reside mostly at cooler temperatures than the ZAMS (with few exceptions). However, with the new distances, the distribution of stellar luminosities became more continuous than obtained previously. The hydrogen-showing stars of late WN subtype are still found to be typically more luminous than the hydrogen-free early subtypes, but there is a range of luminosities where both subclasses overlap. The empirical HRD of the Galactic single WN stars is compared with recent evolutionary tracks. Neither these single-star evolutionary models nor binary scenarios can provide a fully satisfactory explanation for the parameters of these objects and their location in the HRD.},

	abstract = {Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine a previously studied sample of WC stars to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral analyzes remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities ranging from logL/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 4.9-6.0 with one outlier (WR 119) having logL/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging between log Ṁ = -5.1 and -4.1, with Ṁ ∝ L{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}0.68{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and a linear scaling of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.},

These stars are assumed to form in binary systems when their expanding hydrogenic envelopes are promptly lost just after helium ignition. Significant differences are found with single-star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during helium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently, presupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller mass when they die and will be easier to explode. Even accounting for this difference, the helium stars with mass loss develop more centrally condensed cores that should explode more easily than their single-star counterparts. The production of low-mass black holes may be diminished. Helium stars with initial masses below 3.2 \{M\}⊙ experience significant radius expansion after helium depletion, reaching blue supergiant proportions. This could trigger additional mass exchange or affect the light curve of the supernova. The most common black hole mass produced in binaries is estimated to be about 9 \{M\}⊙ .

	abstract = {Context. The observed late-type WC Wolf-Rayet stars (WC7-9) with low luminosity below log L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 5.4 in the HR diagram cannot be reproduced satisfactorily by the evolutionary track of single stars. The mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow drastically modifies the internal structure and surface compositions of two components. Therefore, binaries provide a very promising evolutionary channel to produce these WC stars.  Aims: The Gaia satellite provides accurate distances to WC stars and confirms the luminosities of WC stars. Based on a small grid containing single stars and binaries, we aim to investigate the extent to which the evolution of a single or a close binary can reproduce the properties of these stars.  Methods: We considered single-star models with masses between 20 and 40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We calculated the evolution for three binaries with a 30 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} primary star with a 27 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} companion star with initial orbital periods of 6.0, 20.0, 500.0, and 1000.0 days.  Results: The rotating single star can evolve into a late-type WC star but with high luminosity (i.e., log L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 5.4). Enhanced wind mass loss rates during RSG and WR stages, as proposed in the literature, can cause the star to approach the observational range of low-luminosity WC stars and favor the formation of low-luminosity WO stars. In a wide binary system with initial P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}orb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 1000 days, the primary star can evolve into a late-type WC star and be compatible with the observed properties of the low-luminosity WC stars. The result is almost insensitive to the adopted accretion efficiency 1 − β.  Conclusions: Compared with single stars, the low brightness is due to a smaller temperature gradient inside the star after the Case C Roche lobe overflow, while the low effective temperature is due to envelope expansion. There are four physical reasons for the formation of the expanding envelope. Firstly, less helium envelope can be transferred to the companion star in this system. Heavy helium envelopes can be heated by the helium burning shell and this creates the necessary conditions for the envelope expansion. Secondly, the expansion of the helium envelope can also be boosted by the sharp shrinkage of the larger carbon-oxygen core through the mirror effect. Thirdly, a more massive WC star can attain a higher Eddington factor because of its higher L/M ratio. The increase in L/M with mass is the primary cause for the extended envelopes in WC stars. Finally, the iron opacity bump at T ∼ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5.25{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} K may also trigger envelope inflation because it can lead to a larger Eddington factor.},

	abstract = {Because the majority of massive stars are born as members of close binary systems, populations of massive main-sequence stars contain stellar mergers and products of binary mass transfer. We simulate populations of massive stars accounting for all major binary evolution effects based on the most recent binary parameter statistics and extensively evaluate the effect of model uncertainties. Assuming constant star formation, we find that 8{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-4\}\% of a sample of early-type stars are the products of a merger resulting from a close binary system. In total we find that 30{\textasciicircum}\{+10\}\_\{-15\}\% of massive main-sequence stars are the products of binary interaction. We show that the commonly adopted approach to minimize the effects of binaries on an observed sample by excluding systems detected as binaries through radial velocity campaigns can be counterproductive. Systems with significant radial velocity variations are mostly pre-interaction systems. Excluding them substantially enhances the relative incidence of mergers and binary products in the non-radial velocity variable sample. This poses a challenge for testing single stellar evolutionary models. It also raises the question of whether certain peculiar classes of stars, such as magnetic O stars, are the result of binary interaction and it emphasizes the need to further study the effect of binarity on the diagnostics that are used to derive the fundamental properties (star-formation history, initial mass function, mass-to-light ratio) of stellar populations nearby and at high redshift.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in gravitational-wave astronomy, the direct detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two stellar-mass compact objects has become a realistic prospect. Evolutionary scenarios towards mergers of various double compact objects generally invoke so-called common-envelope evolution, which is poorly understood and leads to large uncertainties in the predicted merger rates. Here we explore, as an alternative, the scenario of massive overcontact binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very massive stars in a very tight binary that remain fully mixed as a result of their tidally induced high spin. While many of these systems merge early on, we find many MOBs that swap mass several times, but survive as a close binary until the stars collapse. The simplicity of the MOB scenario allows us to use the efficient public stellar-evolution code MESA to explore it systematically by means of detailed numerical calculations. We find that, at low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that will merge within a Hubble time with mass-ratios close to one, in two mass ranges, about 25...60 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and ≳130M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, with pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) being produced at intermediate masses. Our models are also able to reproduce counterparts of various stages in the MOB scenario in the local Universe, providing direct support for the scenario. We map the initial binary parameter space that produces BH+BH mergers, determine the expected chirp mass distribution, merger times, and expected Kerr parameters, and predict event rates. We find typically one BH+BH merger event for {\textasciitilde}1000 core-collapse supernovae for Z ≲ Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ 10 . The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detection rate is more uncertain and depends on the cosmic metallicity evolution. From deriving upper and lower limits from a local and a global approximation for the metallicity distribution of massive stars, we estimate aLIGO detection rates (at the aLIGO design limit) of {\textasciitilde}19-550 yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for BH-BH mergers below the PISN gap and of {\textasciitilde}2.1-370 yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} above the PISN gap. Even with conservative assumptions, we find that aLIGO will probably soon detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario. These could be the dominant source for aLIGO detections.},

	abstract = {Context. The first directly detected gravitational waves (GW 150914) were emitted by two coalescing black holes (BHs) with masses of ≈ 36 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and ≈ 29 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Several scenarios have been proposed to put this detection into an astrophysical context. The evolution of an isolated massive binary system is among commonly considered models.  Aims: Various groups have performed detailed binary-evolution calculations that lead to BH merger events. However, the question remains open as to whether binary systems with the predicted properties really exist. The aim of this paper is to help observers to close this gap by providing spectral characteristics of massive binary BH progenitors during a phase where at least one of the companions is still non-degenerate.  Methods: Stellar evolution models predict fundamental stellar parameters. Using these as input for our stellar atmosphere code (Potsdam Wolf-Rayet), we compute a set of models for selected evolutionary stages of massive merging BH progenitors at different metallicities.  Results: The synthetic spectra obtained from our atmosphere calculations reveal that progenitors of massive BH merger events start their lives as O2-3V stars that evolve to early-type blue supergiants before they undergo core-collapse during the Wolf-Rayet phase. When the primary has collapsed, the remaining system will appear as a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary. Based on our atmosphere models, we provide feedback parameters, broad band magnitudes, and spectral templates that should help to identify such binaries in the future.  Conclusions: While the predicted parameter space for massive BH binary progenitors is partly realized in nature, none of the known massive binaries match our synthetic spectra of massive BH binary progenitors exactly. Comparisons of empirically determined mass-loss rates with those assumed by evolution calculations reveal significant differences. The consideration of the empirical mass-loss rates in evolution calculations will possibly entail a shift of the maximum in the predicted binary-BH merger rate to higher metallicities, that is, more candidates should be expected in our cosmic neighborhood than previously assumed.},

	abstract = {Context. The recent gravitational wave measurements have demonstrated the existence of stellar mass black hole binaries. It is essential for our understanding of massive star evolution to identify the contribution of binary evolution to the formation of double black holes.  Aims: A promising way to progress is investigating the progenitors of double black hole systems and comparing predictions with local massive star samples, such as the population in 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Methods: With this purpose in mind, we analysed a large grid of detailed binary evolution models at LMC metallicity with initial primary masses between 10 and 40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and identified the model systems that potentially evolve into a binary consisting of a black hole and a massive main-sequence star. We then derived the observable properties of such systems, as well as peculiarities of the OB star component.  Results: We find that ∼3\% of the LMC late-O and early-B stars in binaries are expected to possess a black hole companion when stars with a final helium core mass above 6.6 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are assumed to form black holes. While the vast majority of them may be X-ray quiet, our models suggest that these black holes may be identified in spectroscopic binaries, either by large amplitude radial velocity variations (≳50 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and simultaneous nitrogen surface enrichment, or through a moderate radial velocity (≳10 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and simultaneous rapid rotation of the OB star. The predicted mass ratios are such that main-sequence companions can be excluded in most cases. A comparison to the observed OB+WR binaries in the LMC, Be and X-ray binaries, and known massive black hole binaries supports our conclusion.  Conclusions: We expect spectroscopic observations to be able to test key assumptions in our models, with important implications for massive star evolution in general and for the formation of double black hole mergers in particular.},

	abstract = {Context. It is now well established that the majority of massive stars reside in multiple systems. However, the effect of multiplicity is not sufficiently understood, resulting in a plethora of uncertainties about the end stages of massive-star evolution. In order to investigate these uncertainties, it is useful to study massive stars just before their demise. Classical Wolf-Rayet stars represent the final end stages of stars at the upper-mass end. The multiplicity fraction of these stars was reported to be ∼0.4 in the Galaxy but no correction for observational biases has been attempted.  Aims: The aim of this study is to conduct a homogeneous radial-velocity survey of a magnitude-limited (V ≤ 12) sample of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars to derive their bias-corrected multiplicity properties. The present paper focuses on 12 northern Galactic carbon-rich (WC) Wolf-Rayet stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator telescope on the island of La Palma.  Methods: We homogeneously measured relative radial velocities (RVs) for carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars using cross-correlation. Variations in the derived RVs were used to flag binary candidates. We investigated probable orbital configurations and provide a first correction of observational biases through Monte-Carlo simulations.  Results: Of the 12 northern Galactic WC stars in our sample, seven show peak-to-peak RV variations larger than 10 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, which we adopt as our detection threshold. This results in an observed spectroscopic multiplicity fraction of 0.58 with a binomial error of 0.14. In our campaign, we find a clear lack of short-period (P \&lt; ∼100 d), indicating that a large number of Galactic WC binaries likely reside in long-period systems. Finally, our simulations show that at the 10\% significance level, the intrinsic multiplicity fraction of the Galactic WC population is at least 0.72. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations made with the Mercator Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma by the Flemish Community, at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained with the HERMES spectrograph, which is supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO), Belgium, the Research Council of KU Leuven, Belgium, the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS), Belgium, the Royal Observatory of Belgium, the Observatoire de Genève, Switzerland and the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, Germany.},

	abstract = {Massive star evolutionary models generally predict the correct ratio of WC-type and WN-type Wolf-Rayet stars at low metallicities, but underestimate the ratio at higher (solar and above) metallicities. One possible explanation for this failure is perhaps single-star models are not sufficient and Roche-lobe overflow in close binaries is necessary to produce the "extra" WC stars at higher metallicities. However, this would require the frequency of close massive binaries to be metallicity dependent. Here we test this hypothesis by searching for close Wolf-Rayet binaries in the high metallicity environments of M31 and the center of M33 as well as in the lower metallicity environments of the middle and outer regions of M33. After identifying {\textasciitilde}100 Wolf-Rayet binaries based on radial velocity variations, we conclude that the close binary frequency of Wolf-Rayets is not metallicity dependent and thus other factors must be responsible for the overabundance of WC stars at high metallicities. However, our initial identifications and observations of these close binaries have already been put to good use as we are currently observing additional epochs for eventual orbit and mass determinations.

	abstract = {Context. Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars dominate the radiative and mechanical energy budget of galaxies and probe a critical phase in the evolution of massive stars prior to core collapse. It is not known whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR; cWR) form predominantly through wind stripping (w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). Whereas spectroscopy of WR binaries has so-far largely been avoided because of its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries and binary candidates of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; metallicity Z ≈ 0.5 Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), which were identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite spectra, or high X-ray luminosities.  Aims: Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive stars at subsolar metallicity and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming these stars.  Methods: Spectroscopy was performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement was performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status was interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically homogeneous evolution.  Results: Among our sample, 28/44 objects show composite spectra and are analyzed as such. An additional five targets show periodically moving WR primaries but no detected companions (SB1); two (BAT99 99 and 112) are potential WR + compact-object candidates owing to their high X-ray luminosities. We cannot confirm the binary nature of the remaining 11 candidates. About two-thirds of the WN components in binaries are identified as cWR, and one-third as hydrogen-burning WR stars. We establish metallicity-dependent mass-loss recipes, which broadly agree with those recently derived for single WN stars, and in which so-called WN3/O3 stars are clear outliers. We estimate that 45 ± 30\% of the cWR stars in our sample have interacted with a companion via mass transfer. However, only ≈12 ± 7\% of the cWR stars in our sample naively appear to have formed purely owing to stripping via a companion (12\% b-WR). Assuming that apparently single WR stars truly formed as single stars, this comprises ≈4\% of the whole LMC WN population, which is about ten times less than expected. No obvious differences in the properties of single and binary WN stars, whose luminosities extend down to log L ≈ 5.2 [L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}], are apparent. With the exception of a few systems (BAT99 19, 49, and 103), the equatorial rotational velocities of the OB-type companions are moderate (v{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 250 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and challenge standard formalisms of angular-momentum accretion. For most objects, chemically homogeneous evolution can be rejected for the secondary, but not for the WR progenitor.  Conclusions: No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.},

	abstract = {Context. Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are massive, hydrogen-depleted, post main-sequence stars that exhibit emission-line dominated spectra. For a given metallicity Z, stars exceeding a certain initial mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) can reach the WR phase through intrinsic mass-loss or eruptions (single-star channel). In principle, stars of lower masses can reach the WR phase via stripping through binary interactions (binary channel). Because winds become weaker at low Z, it is commonly assumed that the binary channel dominates the formation of WR stars in environments with low metallicity such as the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC). However, the reported WR binary fractions of 30-40\% in the SMC (Z = 0.002) and LMC (Z = 0.006) are comparable to that of the Galaxy (Z = 0.014), and no evidence for the dominance of the binary channel at low Z could be identified observationally. Here, we explain this apparent contradiction by considering the minimum initial mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) needed for the stripped product to appear as a WR star.  Aims: By constraining M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z) and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), we estimate the importance of binaries in forming WR stars as a function of Z.  Methods: We calibrated M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} using the lowest-luminosity WR stars in the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. A range of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} values were explored using various evolution codes. We estimated the additional contribution of the binary channel by considering the interval [M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z)], which characterizes the initial-mass range in which the binary channel can form additional WR stars.  Results: The WR-phenomenon ceases below luminosities of log L ≈ 4.9, 5.25, and 5.6 [L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}] in the Galaxy, the LMC, and the SMC, respectively, which translates to minimum He-star masses of 7.5, 11, 17 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and minimum initial masses of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} = 18, 23, 37 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Stripped stars with lower initial masses in the respective galaxies would tend not to appear as WR stars. The minimum mass necessary for self-stripping, M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(Z), is strongly model-dependent, but it lies in the range 20-30, 30-60, and ≳40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC, respectively. We find that that the additional contribution of the binary channel is a non-trivial and model-dependent function of Z that cannot be conclusively claimed to be monotonically increasing with decreasing Z.  Conclusions: The WR spectral appearance arises from the presence of strong winds. Therefore, both M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}spec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}single{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}WR{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} increase with decreasing metallicity. Considering this, we show that one should not a-priori expect that binary interactions become increasingly important in forming WR stars at low Z, or that the WR binary fraction grows with decreasing Z.},

	abstract = {Most massive stars reside in multiple systems that will interact over the course of their lifetime. Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the final end stages of stellar evolution at the upper-mass end. As part of a homogeneous, magnitude-limited (\$V{\textbackslash}leq12\$) spectroscopic survey of northern Galactic WR stars, this paper aims to establish the observed and intrinsic multiplicity properties of the early-type nitrogen-rich WR population (WNE). We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic time series of the complete magnitude-limited sample of 16 WNE stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator telescope at La Palma, typically providing a time base of about two to eight years. We measured relative radial velocities (RVs) using cross-correlation and used RV variations to flag binary candidates. Adopting a peak-to-peak RV variability threshold of 50 km/s as a criterion found an observed multiplicity fraction of 0.44\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.12. Using an updated Monte Carlo method with a Bayesian framework, we calculated the three-dimensional likelihood for the intrinsic binary fraction, the maximum period, and the power-law index for the period distribution for the WNE population. We also re-derived multiplicity parameters for the Galactic WC population. We found an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of \$0.56{\textbackslash}substack\{+0.20 {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} -0.15\}\$ for the parent WNE population. For the Galactic WC population, we re-derive an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of \$0.96{\textbackslash}substack\{+0.04 {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} -0.22\}\$. The derived multiplicity parameters for the WNE population are quite similar to those derived for main-sequence O binaries but differ from those of the WC population. The significant shift in the WC period distribution towards longer periods is too large to be explained via expansion of the orbit due to stellar winds, and we discuss possible implications of our results.},

	abstract = {A detailed study has been carried out on the Galactic WN/C star WR 8 (HD62910), based on ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectroscopy. Our standard model analysis allows a determination of its stellar parameters and chemical abundances of hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. We find that the WN and WC spectral features are consistent with formation in the same stellar wind and derive stellar parameters of T\_*\_=48kK (T\_eff\_=32kK), log(L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_)=5.1, log(˙(M)/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_/yr)=-4.2, v{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}infinity{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_=1590km/s. The chemistry of WR 8 (H/He={\textasciitilde}0, C/He={\textasciitilde}0.02, C/N={\textasciitilde}3, C/O={\textasciitilde}4 by number) is indeed found to be intermediate between normal WN and WC stars, and explains the peculiar WC line spectrum of WR 8. In common with previous WN analyses (e.g. Crowther et al. 1995d) all high and low excitation features cannot be simultaneously reproduced at present, which we attribute to the neglect of line blanketing. We also determine physical parameters and C/He ratios for two other WN/C stars, WR145 (MR111) in the Galaxy and Brey 29 (HDE 269485) in the LMC. The physical properties of these stars are found to be very similar to WR 8, with C/N ratios also estimated to be of order unity. Overall, our results confirm that mixing does take place at the boundary of the convective He core in Wolf-Rayet stars, with an estimated timescale of ={\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4{\textasciicircum} years and are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of Langer (1991, 1994, private communication) in which slow mixing is produced through semi-convection.},

Observations were made over an entire contiguous month using the Garrison spectrograph attached to the 0.6-m Helen Sawyer Hogg telescope at Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito. We obtain improved orbital elements for these five systems and provide an estimation of the orbital inclination and shock-cone opening angle for four of them by analysing excess emission profiles with the geometrical model of Lührs. We argue that line variability in one of the stars (WR 12) might be dominated by some dynamic instabilities in the shocked plasma, making the model inappropriate in this case. A sixth star, WR 69 (WC9d+OB), was observed in the programme based on its published photometric period of 2.293 ± 0.005 d. While we found a probable spectroscopic period of 2.15 ± 0.04 d compatible with that of Marchenko et al. (1998), the period is unlikely related to orbital effects, rather to (relatively fast) rotation of the WC9d component of a much longer binary system.},

It is suggested that a substantial fraction of WR stars without OB companions could have compact companions, but that some WR stars are truly single. The distributions of the various types of WR stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds are compared in order to investigate the lifetimes of the WNL, WNE and WC subgroups. It is argued that WNE and WC stars can not be at the end of core H burning as stellar wind mass loss would not be sufficient for this stage, and evolutionary computations with mass loss by stellar winds are presented for the transition from WNL to WNE based on new effective temperature determinations. It is thus found that the He ZAMS can be situated at much lower effective temperatures than the hydrogen ZAMS.},

Hjellming \&amp; Webbink's (1987) results on the dynamic timescale response of a convective star with a core to mass loss are applied, with new results. It is found that mass transfer is usually stable, as long as the wind's specific angular momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass of the system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal timescale. Included are graphs illustrating the variation of (dln(r\_L\_))/(dln(m))=ζ\_L\_ with mass ratio in the binary, for various parameters in the non-conservative mass transfer, as well as evolutionary paths of interacting red giant neutron star binaries.},

We find that the rotation velocities v of WR stars are modest, i.e. about 50 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, not very dependent on the initial v and masses. For the most massive stars, the evolution of v is very strongly influenced by the values of the mass loss rates; below {\textasciitilde} 12 M\_sun the evolution of rotation during the MS phase and later phases is dominated by the internal coupling. Massive stars with extreme rotation may skip the LBV phase. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Models having a typical v for the O-type stars have WR lifetimes on the average two times longer than for non-rotating models. The increase of the WR lifetimes is mainly due to that of the H-rich eWNL phase. Rotation allows a transition WN/WC phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60 M\_sun. The durations of the other WR subphases are less affected by rotation. The mass threshold for forming WR stars is lowered from 37 to 22 M\_sun for typical rotation. The comparisons of the predicted number ratios WR/O, WN/WC and of the number of transition WN/WC stars show very good agreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models with the present-day mass loss rates and no rotation. As to the chemical abundances in WR stars, rotation brings only very small changes for WN stars, since they have equilibrium CNO values. However, WC stars with rotation have on average lower C/He and O/He ratios. The luminosity distribution of WC stars is also influenced by rotation.},

	abstract = {Context. Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are characterised by strong photometric and spectroscopic variability. They are thought to be in a transitory phase between O-type stars on the main sequence and the Wolf-Rayet stage. Recent studies also evoked the possibility that they might be formed through binary interaction. Only a few are known in binary systems so far, but their multiplicity fraction is still uncertain.  Aims: We derive the binary fraction of the Galactic LBV population. We combine multi-epoch spectroscopy and long-baseline interferometry to probe separations from 0.1 to 120 mas around confirmed and candidate LBVs.  Methods: We used a cross-correlation technique to measure the radial velocities of these objects. We identified spectroscopic binaries through significant radial velocity variability with an amplitude larger than 35 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We also investigated the observational biases to take them into account when we established the intrinsic binary fraction. We used CANDID to detect interferometric companions, derive their flux fractions, and their positions on the sky.  Results: From the multi-epoch spectroscopy, we derive an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of 26{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}−10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+16{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\%. Considering period and mass ratio ranges from log(P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}orb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = 0 − 3 (i.e. from 1 to 1000 days), q = 0.1 − 1.0, and a representative set of orbital parameter distributions, we find a bias-corrected binary fraction of 62{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}−24{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\%. Based on data of the interferometric campaign, we detect a binary fraction of 70 ± 9\% at projected separations between 1 and 120 mas. Based on the derived primary diameters and considering the distances of these objects, we measure for the first time the exact radii of Galactic LBVs to be between 100 and 650 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. This means that it is unlikely that short-period systems are included among LBV-like stars.  Conclusions: This analysis shows for the first time that the binary fraction in the Galactic LBV population is large. If they form through single-star evolution, their orbit must be large initially. If they form through a binary channel, the implication is that either massive stars in short binary systems must undergo a phase of fully non-conservative mass transfer to be able to sufficiently widen the orbit to form an LBV, or that LBVs form through merging in initially binary or triple systems. Interferometric follow-up would provide the distributions of orbital parameters at more advanced stages and would serve to quantitatively test the binary evolution in massive stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table A.1 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A4"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A4{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the ESO Paranal observatory under ESO program 0102.D-0460(A), on spectra obtained with the Mercator Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma by the Flemish Community, at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, on observations made with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) under programme 2019-1-SCI-001, and with the TIGRE telescope, located at La Luz observatory, Mexico (TIGRE is a collaboration of the Hamburger Sternwarte, the Universities of Hamburg, Guanajuato, and Liège).},

	abstract = {Context. Hierarchical triple stars are ideal laboratories for studying the interplay between orbital dynamics and stellar evolution. Both mass loss from stellar winds and strong gravitational perturbations between the inner and outer orbit cooperate to destabilise triple systems.  Aims: Our current understanding of the evolution of unstable triple systems is mainly built upon results from extensive binary-single scattering experiments. However, destabilised hierarchical triples cover a different region of phase space. Therefore, we aim to construct a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary pathways of destabilised triple-star systems.  Methods: Starting from generic initial conditions, we evolved an extensive set of hierarchical triples using the code TRES, combining secular dynamics and stellar evolution. We detected those triples that destabilise due to stellar winds and/or gravitational perturbations. Their evolution was continued with a direct N-body integrator coupled to stellar evolution.  Results: The majority of triples (54-69\%) preserve their hierarchy throughout their evolution, which is in contradiction with the commonly adopted picture that unstable triples always experience a chaotic, democratic resonant interaction. The duration of the unstable phase was found to be longer than expected (10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3 − 4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} crossing times, reaching up to millions), so that long-term stellar evolution effects cannot be neglected. The most probable outcome is dissolution of the triple into a single star and binary (42-45\%). This occurs through the commonly known democratic channel, during which the initial hierarchy is lost and the lightest body usually escapes, but also through a hierarchical channel, during which the tertiary is ejected in a slingshot, independent of its mass. Collisions are common (13-24\% of destabilised triples), and they mostly involve the two original inner binary components still on the main sequence (77-94\%). This contradicts the idea that collisions with a giant during democratic encounters dominate (only 5-12\%). Together with collisions in stable triples, we find that triple evolution is the dominant mechanism for stellar collisions in the Milky Way. Lastly, our simulations produce runaway and walk-away stars with speeds up to several tens of km/s, with a maximum of a few 100 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We suggest that destabilised triples can explain - or at least alleviate the tension behind - the origin of the observed (massive) runaway stars.  Conclusions: A promising indicator for distinguishing triples that will follow the democratic or hierarchical route, is the relative inclination between the inner and outer orbits. Its influence can be summed up in two rules of thumb: (1) prograde triples tend to evolve towards hierarchical collisions and ejections, and (2) retrograde triples tend to evolve towards democratic encounters and a loss of initial hierarchy, unless the system is compact, which experience collision preferentially. The trends found in this work complement those found previously from binary-single scattering experiments, and together they will help to generalise and improve our understanding on the evolution of unstable triple systems of various origins.},

The lower upper limit Delta V/Delta P implies that the intrinsic linearly polarized light which does vary cannot be produced by electrons gyrating in a magnetic field, unless they are ultrarelativistic - a rather unlikely situation. The low mean circular polarization typically observed is probably interstellar in origin. Lack of periodicity in the observed variations of linear polarization implies that even weak magnetic field loops are unlikely to be involved in confining pockets of wind plasma.

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven.

It is suggested that a substantial fraction of WR stars without OB companions could have compact companions, but that some WR stars are truly single. The distributions of the various types of WR stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds are compared in order to investigate the lifetimes of the WNL, WNE and WC subgroups. It is argued that WNE and WC stars can not be at the end of core H burning as stellar wind mass loss would not be sufficient for this stage, and evolutionary computations with mass loss by stellar winds are presented for the transition from WNL to WNE based on new effective temperature determinations. It is thus found that the He ZAMS can be situated at much lower effective temperatures than the hydrogen ZAMS.},

It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage. I show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.},

	abstract = {Common-envelope (CE) evolution in massive binary systems is thought to be one of the most promising channels for the formation of compact binary mergers. In the case of merging binary black holes (BBHs), the essential CE phase takes place at a stage when the first BH is already formed and the companion star expands as a supergiant. We aim to decipher the kinds of BH binaries with supergiant companions that could potentially evolve through and survive a CE phase. To this end, we compute envelope binding energies from detailed massive stellar models at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. We make multiple physically extreme choices of assumptions that favor easier CE ejection as well as account for recent advancements in mass-transfer stability criteria. We find that even with the most optimistic assumptions, a successful CE ejection in BH binaries is only possible if the donor is a massive convective-envelope giant, namely a red supergiant (RSG). The same is true for neutron-star binaries with massive companions. In other words, pre-CE progenitors of BBH mergers are BH binaries with RSG companions. We find that because of its influence on the radial expansion of massive giants, metallicity has an indirect but a very strong effect on the chemical profile, density structure, and the binding energies of RSG envelopes. Our results suggest that merger rates from population-synthesis models could be severely overestimated, especially at low metallicity. Additionally, the lack of observed RSGs with luminosities above log(L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) ≈ 5.6 - 5.8, corresponding to stars with M ≳ 40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, puts into question the viability of the CE channel for the formation of the most massive BBH mergers. Either such RSGs elude detection due to very short lifetimes, or they do not exist and the CE channel can only produce BBH systems with total mass ≲50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Finally, we discuss an alternative CE scenario in which a partial envelope ejection is followed by a phase of possibly long and stable mass transfer.},

Supergiants of similar spectral types have the same luminosities, except for the A-type stars, where selection effects may be important. These results suggest that the same basic physical processes govern the evolution of the most massive stars in the two galaxies. Variations in the blue-to-red supergiant ratio with galactocentric distance and with luminosity involve chemical composition gradients and varying rates of mass loss. Since the relative numbers of the most luminous stars are more sensitive to mass loss, the B/R ratio from the less luminous supergiants may be a better indicator of galactic abundance gradients. The upper luminosity boundary for both the galactic and the LMC supergiants is characterized by (1) decreasing luminosity with decreasing temperature for the hottest stars and (2) an upper limit to the luminosities near Mbol - 9.5 to - 10 mag for stars cooler than 15,000 K. We suggest that the observed luminosity limits are due primarily to the effects of large mass loss on the evolution of the most massive stars. The examples of Car and P Cyg suggest that mass-loss rates can be very rapid and unsteady-higher on the average than presently observed for most of the hot supergiants. The evolution of stars greater than 60 to cooler temperatures is consequently limited by instabilities and the accompanying high mass loss. An initial mass near may be an empirical upper limit to the mass at which a star can evolve to the region of the M supergiants and probably accounts for the observed upper bound to the luminosities of the cooler supergiants.

	abstract = {The empirical upper luminosity boundary Lmax of cool supergiants (SGs), often referred to as the Humphreys-Davidson limit, is thought to encode information on the general mass-loss behaviour of massive stars. Further, it delineates the boundary at which single stars will end their lives stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelope, which in turn is a key factor in the relative rates of Type-II to Type-Ibc supernovae from single star channels. In this paper we have revisited the issue of Lmax by studying the luminosity distributions of cool SGs in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC). We assemble samples of cool SGs in each galaxy which are highly complete above logL/L⊙= 5.0, and determine their spectral energy distributions from the optical to the mid-infrared using modern multiwavelength survey data. We show that in both cases Lmax appears to be lower than previously quoted, and is in the region of log L/L⊙ = 5.5. There is no evidence for Lmax being higher in the SMC than in the LMC, as would be expected if metallicity-dependent winds were the dominant factor in the stripping of stellar envelopes. We also show that Lmax aligns with the lowest luminosity of single nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, indicating of a change in evolutionary sequence for stars above a critical mass. From population synthesis analysis we show that the Geneva evolutionary models greatly overpredict the numbers of cool SGs in the SMC. We also argue that the trend of earlier average spectral types of cool SGs in lower metallicity environments represents a genuine shift to hotter temperatures. Finally, we use our new bolometric luminosity measurements to provide updated bolometric corrections for cool SGs.},

Attempts to explain this limit through instabilities arising in near- or super-Eddington winds have been largely unsuccessful. Using modern stellar evolution, we aim to re-examine the HD limit, investigating the impact of enhanced mixing on massive stars. We construct grids of stellar evolution models appropriate for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as well as for the Galaxy, spanning various initial rotation rates and convective overshooting parameters. Significantly enhanced mixing apparently steers stellar evolution tracks away from the region of the HD limit. To quantify the excess of overluminous stars in stellar evolution simulations, we generate synthetic populations of massive stars and make detailed comparisons with catalogues of cool ( \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\} {\textbackslash}le 12.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kK\}\$ ) and luminous (log10(L/L⊙) ≥ 4.7) stars in the SMC and LMC. We find that adjustments to the mixing parameters can lead to agreement between the observed and simulated red supergiant populations, but for hotter supergiants the simulations always overpredict the number of very luminous (log10(L/L⊙) ≥ 5.4) stars compared to observations. The excess of luminous supergiants decreases for enhanced mixing, possibly hinting at an important role mixing has in explaining the HD limit. Still, the HD limit remains unexplained for hotter supergiants.},

	abstract = {Context. It has been proposed that the envelopes of luminous stars may be subject to substantial radius inflation. The peculiar structure of such inflated envelopes, with an almost void, radiatively dominated region beneath a thin, dense shell could mean that many in reality compact stars are hidden below inflated envelopes, displaying much lower effective temperatures. The inflation effect has been discussed in relation to the radius problem of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, but has yet failed to explain the large observed radii of Galactic WR stars.  Aims: We wish to obtain a physical perspective of the inflation effect, and study the consequences for the radii of WR stars, and luminous blue variables (LBVs). For WR stars the observed radii are up to an order of magnitude larger than predicted by theory, whilst S Doradus-type LBVs are subject to humongous radius variations, which remain as yet ill-explained.  Methods: We use a dual approach to investigate the envelope inflation, based on numerical models for stars near the Eddington limit, and a new analytic formalism to describe the effect. An additional new aspect is that we take the effect of density inhomogeneities (clumping) within the outer stellar envelopes into account.  Results: Due to the effect of clumping we are able to bring the observed WR radii in agreement with theory. Based on our new formalism, we find that the radial inflation is a function of a dimensionless parameter W, which largely depends on the topology of the Fe-opacity peak, i.e., on material properties. For W \&gt; 1, we discover an instability limit, for which the stellar envelope becomes gravitationally unbound, i.e. there no longer exists a static solution. Within this framework we are also able to explain the S Doradus-type instabilities for LBVs like AG Car, with a possible triggering due to changes in stellar rotation.  Conclusions: The stellar effective temperatures in the upper Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram are potentially strongly affected by the inflation effect. This may have particularly strong effects on the evolved massive LBV and WR stars just prior to their final collapse, as the progenitors of supernovae (SNe) Ibc, SNe II, and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (long GRBs).},

	abstract = {Context. Massive stars play a vital role in the Universe, however, their evolution even on the main-sequence is not yet well understood.  Aims: Because of the steep mass-luminosity relation, massive main-sequence stars become extremely luminous. This brings their envelopes very close to the Eddington limit. We analyse stellar evolutionary models in which the Eddington limit is reached and exceeded, explore the rich diversity of physical phenomena that take place in their envelopes, and investigate their observational consequences.  Methods: We use published grids of detailed stellar models, computed with a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code using LMC composition, to investigate the envelope properties of core hydrogen burning massive stars.  Results: We find that the Eddington limit is almost never reached at the stellar surface, even for stars up to 500 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. When we define an appropriate Eddington limit locally in the stellar envelope, we can show that most stars more massive than {\textasciitilde}40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} actually exceed this limit, in particular, in the partial ionisation zones of iron, helium, or hydrogen. While most models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is exceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor of more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope inflation, convection, density inversions, and, possibly to, pulsations. We find that all models with luminosities higher than 4 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, i.e. stars above {\textasciitilde}40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a possible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our coolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several solar masses, and appear to be candidates for producing major luminous blue variable eruptions.  Conclusions: Our models show that the Eddington limit is expected to be reached in all stars above {\textasciitilde}40 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in the LMC, even in lower mass stars in the Galaxy, or in close binaries or rapid rotators. While our results do not support the idea of a direct super-Eddington wind driven by continuum photons, the consequences of the Eddington limit in the form of inflation, pulsations and possibly eruptions may well give rise to a significant enhancement of the time averaged mass-loss rate. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525945/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mass loss by stellar wind is a key agent in the evolution and spectroscopic appearance of massive main sequence and post-main sequence stars. In Wolf-Rayet stars the winds can be so dense and so optically thick that the photosphere appears in the highly supersonic part of the outflow, veiling the underlying subsonic part of the star, and leaving the initial acceleration of the wind inaccessible to observations. Here we investigate the conditions and the structure of the subsonic part of the outflow of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, in particular of the WNE subclass; our focus is on the conditions at the sonic point of their winds. We compute 1D hydrodynamic stellar structure models for massive helium stars adopting outer boundaries at the sonic point. We find that the outflows of our models are accelerated to supersonic velocities by the radiative force from opacity bumps either at temperatures of the order of 200 kK by the iron opacity bump or of the order of 50 kK by the helium-II opacity bump. For a given mass-loss rate, the diffusion approximation for radiative energy transport allows us to define the temperature gradient based purely on the local thermodynamic conditions. For a given mass-loss rate, this implies that the conditions in the subsonic part of the outflow are independent from the detailed physical conditions in the supersonic part. Stellar atmosphere calculations can therefore adopt our hydrodynamic models as ab initio input for the subsonic structure. The close proximity to the Eddington limit at the sonic point allows us to construct a sonic HR diagram, relating the sonic point temperature to the luminosity-to-mass ratio and the stellar mass-loss rate, thereby constraining the sonic point conditions, the subsonic structure, and the stellar wind mass-loss rates of WNE stars from observations. The minimum stellar wind mass-loss rate necessary to have the flow accelerated to supersonic velocities by the iron opacity bump is derived. A comparison of the observed parameters of Galactic WNE stars to this minimum mass-loss rate indicates that these stars have their winds launched to supersonic velocities by the radiation pressure arising from the iron opacity bump. Conversely, stellar models which do not show transonic flows from the iron opacity bump form low-density extended envelopes. We derive an analytic criterion for the appearance of envelope inflation and of a density inversion in the outer sub-photospheric layers.},

	abstract = {Early-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stellar models harbor a super-Eddington layer in their outer envelopes due to a prominent iron opacity bump. In the past few decades, one-dimensional hydrostatic and time-steady hydrodynamic models have suggested a variety of WR responses to a super-Eddington force including envelope inflation and optically thick winds. In this paper, I study these responses using semianalytical estimates and WR models from both MESA and Ro \& Matzner; four conclusions are present. First, early-type WR stars do not harbor inflated envelopes because they have either strong winds or insufficient luminosities. Second, the condition for an opacity bump to harbor a sonic point is expressible as a minimum mass-loss rate, \{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\vphantom{\{}\}\}sp\}(\{L\}* ). In agreement with Grassitelli et al. and Ro, the majority of galactic early-type WR stars can harbor sonic points at the iron opacity bump. However, about half of those in the Large Magellanic Cloud cannot given typical wind parameters. Third, WR winds driven by the iron opacity bump must have mass-loss rates that exceed a global minimum of 10-5.8-10-6 \{M\}⊙ yr \{\}-1. Lastly, the observed early-type WR distribution follows a simple mass-loss relation derived here if the radiation-to-gas pressure ratio is approximately pr/pg ≃ 145 in the wind; a value consistent with studies by Gräfener et al. and Nakauchi \& Saio.},

In this paper, we use a suite of hydrodynamic models of coalescing binaries involving an extended donor and a more compact accretor. We focus on the period of unstable Roche Lobe overflow that ends as the accretor plunges within the envelope of the donor at the onset of a common envelope phase. During this stage, mass is removed from the donor and flung into the circumbinary environment. Across a wide range of binary mass ratios, we find that the mass expelled as the separation decreases from the Roche limit to the donor's original radius is of the order of 25\% of the accretor's mass. We study the kinematics of this ejecta and its dependencies on binary properties and find that it assembles into a toroidal circumbinary distribution. These circumbinary tori have approximately constant specific angular momenta due to momentum transport by spiral shocks launched from the orbiting binary. We show that an analytic model with these torus properties captures many of the main features of the azimuthally averaged profiles of our hydrodynamic simulations. Our results, in particular the simple relationship between accretor mass and expelled mass and its spatial distribution, may be useful for interpreting stellar coalescence transients like luminous red novae and initializing hydrodynamic simulations of the subsequent common envelope phase.},

After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P ≲ 20 days (separations a ≲ 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e ≲ 0.4, favor modest mass ratios {\textless} q{\textgreater} ≈ 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q {\textgreater} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) ≈ 3.5 (a ≈ 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q ≈ 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian “thermal” eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) ≈ 5.5-7.5 (a ≈ 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q ≈ 0.1-1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function.

While the evolution of single stars and binaries have been studied extensively, the same is not true for the evolution of stellar triples.  Aims: To fill in this gap in our general understanding of stellar lives, we aim to systematically explore the long-term evolution of triples and to map out the most common evolutionary pathways that triples go through. We quantitatively study how triples evolve, which processes are the most relevant, and how this differs from binary evoluion.  Methods: We simulated the evolution of several large populations of triples with a population synthesis approach. We made use of the triple evolution code TRES to simulate the evolution of each triple in a consistent way, including three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach), stellar evolution, and their mutual influences. We simulated the evolution of the system up until mass transfer starts, the system becomes dynamically unstable, or a Hubble time has passed.  Results: We find that stellar interactions are common in triples. Compared to a binary population, we find that the fraction of systems that can undergo mass transfer is ∼2-3 times larger in triples. Moreover, while orbits typically reach circularisation before Roche-lobe overflow in binaries, this is no longer true in triples. In our simulations, about 40\% of systems retain an eccentric orbit. Additionally, we discuss various channels of triple evolution in detail, such as those where the secondary or the tertiary is the first star to initiate a mass transfer event.},

However, a system comprising a 37 M\_\{⊙\} secondary (typical mass of an O5V star) and a 33 M\_\{⊙\} primary (given the mass ratio) would infer an inclination of ∼18°. We therefore reconsider the previous methods of deriving the orbital inclination based on time-dependent polarimetry and photometry. While the polarimetric results are inconclusive requiring better data, the photometric results favour low inclinations. Finally, we compute WR 148's space velocity and retrace the runaway's trajectory back to the Galactic plane (GP). With an ejection velocity of 198 ± 27 km s-1 and a travel time of 4.7 ± 0.8 Myr to reach its current location, WR 148 was most likely ejected via dynamical interactions in a young cluster.},

It is shown that there is only one Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star in GP Cep, contrary to a previous claim. A rate of change P=1.3+/-0.2 s yr-1 is determined for the W-R+O pair, which leads to a new period of 6.6887 days and to a W-R mass-loss rate of (0.8-3.0)×10-5 Msolar yr-1. Masses for this pair are estimated to be MW-R{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}6 Msolar and MO{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}21 Msolar. The effects of wind-wind collision in the W-R+O pair are studied. It is shown that even after allowing for dilution by the OB components of the quadruple system, these effects are not as strong as in the binary V444 Cygni (WN5+O6, P=4.212 days). In GP Cep, the phase-dependent, relatively weak excess emission does not originate in the arms of the bow shock cone. Rather, it emerges from the extra heated portion of the W-R wind facing the hot O companion. The trailing bow shock arm is clearly seen, however, as an enhanced He I absorption component near quadrature at phase {\textasciitilde}0.73. An anomalous blueshifted He I absorption is present at phase {\textasciitilde}0.9, as is also seen in V444 Cyg, in the WC8+O9 I/O8 III binary γ Velorum and in the LBV-cotype binary R81 (B2.5 Iab:e). A 3.5 day orbit for the eclipsing B star pair is confirmed.},

Fourier analysis shows that no periodic signal is stable for more than several days in the low-frequency domain (f{\textless} 1 day-1), where most of the stochastic power is contained. Also, no significant variability is seen in the high-frequency domain (10 day-1 {\textless} f {\textless} 1400 day-1) down to the level of 0.2 mmag, an order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions for strange-mode pulsations. On the other hand, there seems to be a relatively stable 9.8 hr periodic signal present throughout the whole run. This period is probably too short to represent the axial rotation of the star, unless it is related to multiple substructures equidistantly spread along the stellar equator. It is also too short to be orbital in nature; it is more likely to be related to pulsational instablilities (although with a much longer period than expected), thus finally revealing a possible fundamental driver behind the highly variable wind of this object, and others of similar type.},

A dedicated spectroscopic campaign targets the ten-hour period previously found in the high-precision photometric data obtained by the MOST satellite.  Methods: In June-August 2003 we obtained a series of high signal-to-noise, mid-resolution spectra from several sites in the λλ 4000-6940 Å domain. We also followed the star with occasional broadband (Johnson V) photometry. The acquired spectroscopy allowed a detailed study of spectral variability on timescales from {\textasciitilde}5 min to months.  Results: We find that all observed spectral lines of a given chemical element tend to show similar variations and that there is a good correlation between the lines of different elements, without any significant time delays, save the strong absorption components of the Hei lines, which tend to vary differently from the emission parts. We find a single sustained periodicity, P {\textasciitilde} 9.8 h, which is likely related to the relatively stable pulsations found in MOST photometry obtained one year later. In addition, seemingly stochastic, large-amplitude variations are also seen in all spectral lines on timescales of several hours to several days. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Concil of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

It has long been suggested that WN8h-type stars are the products of binary evolution that may harbor neutron stars (NS). One of the most intriguing WN8h stars is the runaway WR 124 surrounded by its magnificent nebula M1-67. We test the presence of an accreting NS companion in WR 124 using ∼100 ks long observations by the Chandra X-ray observatory. The hard X-ray emission from WR 124 with a luminosity of L X ∼ 1031 erg s-1 is marginally detected. We use the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium stellar atmosphere code PoWR to estimate the WR wind opacity to the X-rays. The wind of a WN8-type star is effectively opaque for X-rays, hence the low X-ray luminosity of WR 124 does not rule out the presence of an embedded compact object. We suggest that, in general, high-opacity WR winds could prevent X-ray detections of embedded NS, and be an explanation for the apparent lack of WR+NS systems.},

Tusi Shamakha Astrophysical Observatory (ShAO) of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan in 2006-2010 are presented. The spectral observations were carried out at the ShAO Zeiss-2000 telescope with an echelle spectrometer. Thirty-four echelle spectrograms of WR 134 were obtained. Profiles of the five strongest emission lines were analyzed: HeII 4859, HeII 5411, CIV 5808, HeI 5875, and (HeII+H α) 6560. Various parameters of these emission lines are determined: their equivalent widths, radial velocities, central intensities, and half-widths. Only the radial velocity was found to be variable. Variability of the shapes of all emission-line profiles was found, but the largest changes are observed for the (HeII+H α) 6560 emission band. Photometric observations were carried out at the ShAO Zeiss-600 telescope using an Alta U-47 CCD array (1024 × 1024 pixels) in the V filter of the photometric UBV system. Photometric observations were carried out on 18 nights, with from 100 to 300 measurements made during each night. The mean V magnitudes of WR 134 and a control star were determined for each night. Variability of WR 134 was detected, both within a night and during the entire observation period. The exposure time varied from 1 to 6 s on different nights. A statistical analysis of the mean magnitudes indicated that this series contains a peak at a frequency of ν = 0.530 day-1, corresponding to the period P = 1.887d. This period is interpreted as the manifestation binarity for this star. It is suggested that the secondary component of the system may be a low-mass optical K-M star.},

	abstract = {New spectroscopic and polarimetric data for the single-line spectroscopic binary HD 197406 are presented. We derive a more accurate period and mass function from an improved radial velocity orbit based on all spectroscopic measures available to date. Polarimetric observations allow us to determine (1) that the inclination of the orbital plane i ≍ 67° , combined with the mass function f(m) = 0.28 Msun, yields a mass of 12.4 Msun for the unseen companion if we suppose MWN7 = 60 Msun for the Wolf-Rayet primary, and (2) that the scattering material responsible for the intrinsic polarization variations is not located preferentially near the line joining the two stars. This system is shown to be a runaway, and in many respects resembles the OB supergiant + black hole (BH) binary HDE 226868 (Cyg X-1), except that HD 197406 is not an X-ray source. If the unseen companion of HD 197406 is a BH, the recoil from a preceding supernova explosion may be the cause of its present runaway status. Alternatively, whether HD 197406 possesses a BH or a normal star companion, we cannot exclude a priori the possibility that the binary was slung out of a protocluster during its rapid contraction phase.},

These variations describe a double wave with orbital phase, which is consistent with electron scattering in a binary system. The amplitude of the polarization variations in CQ Cep appears to be the largest found among binary stars, excluding the special case of magnetic white dwarfs in close binaries. This may be a consequence of a dense W-R wind in the shortest period binary W-R system known. The orbital inclination derived from the polarimetric data is roughly 78 deg, only slightly different from the value of about 70 deg derived from photometric data. Combining the value of the orbital inclination with the mass function and the mass ratio, masses of 42 and 30 solar masses are found for the WN7 star and the unseen O star companion, respectively.},

Besides confirming a previous orbit based on the N iv 4058 Å emission line, these spectroscopic data show phase-dependent, line-profile variations, especially in He II. The low mass function, but normal orbital inclination, implies that the companion is either a normal B2-B4 V-III star or a relativistic object. In either case, the phase-dependent line variations lead to the suggestion of an ionized cavity near the companion that is probably created from X-rays generated via impact of the W-R wind on the windless B star, or via accretion on the relativistic companion. This is borne out in the light curve, based on new data combined with all previously published data, which shows a broad minimum when the W-R component is closest to the observer. Compared to all other light curves known for W-R + OB systems, HD 197406's light curve requires the secondary light to arise in an extended region, presumably the hot cavity. Some preference is shown for the scenario involving a relativistic companion, from timing arguments of the orbiting ionized cavity. Despite the strong ionization, its local nature ensures that HD 197406 remains only a weak observed X-ray source.},

	abstract = {We present results from the B-type binaries characterization (BBC) programme, a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of 88 early B-type binary candidates in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From radial-velocity analysis of 29 observational epochs, we confirm the binary status of 64 of our targets, comprising 50 SB1 and 14 SB2 B-type binaries. A further 20 systems (classified as SB1*) show clear signs of periodicity but with more tentative periods. Orbital solutions are presented for these 84 systems, providing the largest homogeneous sample to date of the binary properties of early B-type stars. Our derived orbital-period distribution is generally similar to those for samples of more massive (O-type) binaries in both the LMC and the Galaxy. This similarity with the properties of the more massive O-type binaries is important as early B-type stars are expected to account for the majority of core-collapse supernovae. Differences in the period distributions of the different samples start to increase above 4 d, and are also present between the earliest (B0-0.7) and later-type (B1-2.5) systems within the BBC sample, although further study is required to understand if this is an observational bias or a real physical effect. We have examined the semi-amplitude velocities and orbital periods of our sample to identify potential candidates that could hide compact companions. Comparing with probability distributions of finding black hole companions to OB-type stars from a recent theoretical study, we have found 16 binaries in the higher probability region that warrant further study.},

	abstract = {Context: .Recent results strongly challenge the canonical picture of massive star winds: various evidence indicates that currently accepted mass-loss rates, \{dot M\}, may need to be revised downwards, by factors extending to one magnitude or even more. This is because the most commonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by "clumping" (small-scale density inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra and fluxes. Aims: .Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the evolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations of the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. We present a first attempt concerning this objective, by means of constraining the radial stratification of the so-called clumping factor. Methods: .To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type supergiants/giants, by combining our own and archival data for H$\alpha$, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and using approximate methods, calibrated to more sophisticated models. Clumping has been included into our analysis in the "conventional" way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be void. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we cannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a certain minimum. Results: .This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost, radio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones, compared to \{dot M\} derived from H$\alpha$ and the IR. The radio rates agree well with those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown clumping in the outer wind. H$\alpha$ turned out to be a useful tool to derive the clumping properties inside r \&lt; 3\{ldots\}5 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Our most important result concerns a (physical) difference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost region is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized clumping factor of 4.1 {\textpm} 1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping properties in the inner and outer regions. Conclusions: .Our findings are compared with theoretical predictions, and the implications are discussed in detail, by assuming different scenarios regarding the still unknown clumping properties of the outer wind.},

When P+4 is the dominant ion in the wind [i.e., 0.5{\textless}{\textasciitilde}q(P+4){\textless}=1], M?q(P+4) approximates the mass-loss rate to within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2. Theory predicts that P+4 is the dominant ion in the winds of O7-O9.7 stars, although an empirical estimator suggests that the range O4-O7 may be more appropriate. However, we find that the mass-loss rates obtained from P V wind profiles are systematically smaller than those obtained from fits to H$\alpha$ emission profiles or radio free-free emission by median factors of {\textasciitilde}130 (if P+4 is dominant between O7 and O9.7) or {\textasciitilde}20 (if P+4 is dominant between O4 and O7). These discordant measurements can be reconciled if the winds of O stars in the relevant temperature range are strongly clumped on small spatial scales. We use a simplified two-component model to investigate the volume filling factors of the denser regions. This clumping implies that mass-loss rates determined from ``$\rho$2'' diagnostics have been systematically overestimated by factors of 10 or more, at least for a subset of O stars. Reductions in the mass-loss rates of this size have important implications for the evolution of massive stars and quantitative estimates of the feedback that hot-star winds provide to their interstellar environments.},

	abstract = {We describe a new technique involving wavelet transforms for analyzing discrete stochastic components like those found on the tops of emission lines in Wolf-Rayet stars. A wavelet power spectrum is used to characterize the variable component of the emission line we believe arises from the superposition of many individual Gaussian-like subpeaks. This was applied to emission-line spectra of eight Wolf-Rayet stars obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and European Southern Observatory. Where the data show the most power we identify a dominant scale, which is found to be very similar in all but one of the stars in our sample. We present a phenomenological model where the variable structure on top of the emission line is represented by a sum of individual subpeaks of the same simple shape (Gaussian or triangular) and various scales. This model is used to introduce the idea of scaling laws. The amplitude A and number density N of subpeaks on a given scale are related to their characteristic width $\sigma$ (i.e., velocity dispersion) by scaling relations, of which the simplest form is a power law: A \~{} $\sigma$$\alpha$ and N \~{} $\sigma$$\beta$. The wavelet power spectrum is used to verify the consistency of this model with the data. Synthetic signals are generated, and their wavelet spectra are compared to those of the data. This provides a constraint on the value of 2$\alpha$ + $\beta$, which is found to be 2.7{\textpm}0.5(s.d.) for the model involving Gaussians, or ?3.4{\textpm}0.6(s.d.) for the model involving triangles. The implications provided by this new constraint are discussed.},

The Wolf-Rayet star HD 192103 (=WR 135; subtype WC8) was observed in the 5650-5840 {\r A} regime alternately from both the William Herschel Telescope and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The final data consist of a series of 197 spectra spread over 64 hr, each with a resolving power $\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda${\textasciitilde}=20,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio in the continuum {\textasciitilde}=450 per 3 pixel resolution element. We clearly and unambiguously identify stochastic, structured patterns of intrinsic variability at the 1\%-2\% level of the line flux in the broad C III $\lambda$5696 emission line. The $\lambda$5801/12 doublet emission is also found to be variable at the 0.2\%-0.5\% level of the line flux. We find a correlation between the variability patterns observed in C III and C IV, which suggests a significant overlap in the emission volumes of these transitions, although C IV is known to arise somewhat closer to the star. We attempt to reproduce the observed line profile variation patterns using a simple phenomenological model, which assumes the wind to be fully clumped. With a minimal set of assumptions, we are able to reproduce both the shape and the variability in the C III $\lambda$5696 emission profile. We show that the variability pattern provides constraints on the radial extent of WR 135's wind where C III is produced, as well as on the local wind acceleration rate. However, our simple clump model does not reproduce the lower variability in the C IV doublet unless we assume the C IV emission to occur in a much larger volume than C III, implying that significant C IV emission occurs farther out in the wind than C III. We suggest that while some C IV emission might occur farther out, possibly because of reionization from shocks, a more likely explanation is that wind clumping significantly increases with distance from the star, leading to larger variability levels in C III, formed farther out than most of C IV. Alternatively, optical depth effects and/or local ionization gradients within clumps could conspire to attenuate clumping effects in the C IV emission line while enhancing them in the C III line.},

In this first paper we characterize the various forms of variability detected and distinguish several separate groups. For each star in our sample, we obtained 4-5 high-resolution spectra with signal-to-noise ratio {\textasciitilde}100. Our ultimate goal is to identify new candidates presenting variability that potentially comes from corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Out of a sample of 25 stars, 10 were found to display large-scale changes of which four are of CIR-type (WR 1, WR 115, WR 120, and WR 134). The star WR 134 was already known to show such changes from previous studies. Three WN8 stars present a different type of large-scale variability and we believe deserve a group of their own. Also, all three WC9d stars in our sample present large-scale variability, but it remains to be checked if these are binaries, as many dust-making WR stars are double. Finally, of the remaining stars, 10 were found to show small-amplitude spectral changes, which we attribute to normal line-profile variability due to inhomogeneities in the wind, and five were found to show no spectral variability, as far as can be concluded from the data in hand. Follow-up studies are required to identify potential periods for our candidates showing CIR-type changes and eventually estimate a rotation rate for these WR stars.},

In a previous paper (Paper I), we described and characterized the spectroscopic variability level of 25 WR stars observable from the northern hemisphere and found 3 new candidates presenting large-scale wind variability, potentially originating from large-scale structures named corotating interaction regions (CIRs). In this second paper, we discuss an additional 39 stars observable from the southern hemisphere. For each star in our sample, we obtained 4-5 high-resolution spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of {\textasciitilde}100 and determined its variability level using the approach described in Paper I. In total, 10 new stars are found to show large-scale spectral variability of which 7 present CIR-type changes (WR 8, WR 44, WR55, WR 58, WR 61, WR 63, WR 100). Of the remaining stars, 20 were found to show small-amplitude changes and 9 were found to show no spectral variability as far as can be concluded from the data on hand. Also, we discuss the spectroscopic variability level of all single galactic WR stars that are brighter than v {\textasciitilde} 12.5, and some WR stars with 12.5 {\textless} v {\textless}= 13.5, i.e., all the stars presented in our two papers and four more stars for which spectra have already been published in the literature. We find that 23/68 stars (33.8\%) present large-scale variability, but only 12/54 stars ({\textasciitilde}22.1\%) are potentially of CIR type. Also, we find that 31/68 stars (45.6\%) only show small-scale variability, most likely due to clumping in the wind. Finally, no spectral variability is detected based on the data on hand for 14/68 (20.6\%) stars. Interestingly, the variability with the highest amplitude also has the widest mean velocity dispersion.},

These three stars have T* = 140 and 200 kK, the last two being well above the bulk of WR stars with T* \~{} 40-120 kK. This full temperature range for WR stars is much broader than that of their O-star progenitors (\~{}30-50 kK), so is better suited to look for any temperature dependence of wind clumping. We have obtained multiple observations with high signal-to-noise, moderate-resolution spectroscopy in search of small-scale variability in the strong emission lines from the dense winds of these three extreme stars, and find a very low-level of variability in both stars. Temperature and terminal velocity are correlated, so faster winds show a lower variability, though this trend goes against any predictions made involving Line Deshadowing Instability (LDI) only, implying that instabilities intrinsic to LDI are not the main source of wind clumping. Instead, it could be taken as support for the suggestion that clumps are caused by a subsurface convection zone (SSCZ) at T \~{} 170 kK, since such an SSCZ would have little opportunity to operate under the hydrostatic surface of these hottest WR stars. It is still possible, however, that an SSCZ-related driver could interact with nonlinear line instability effects to enhance or possibly even produce clumps.},

We present observations of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}WR 1{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} which highlight the unusual character of the variations in this object. Our narrowband photometric observations reveal a gradual increase of the stellar continuum flux amounting to Delta v {\textasciitilde} 0.09 mag followed by a decline on about the same timescale (3-4 days). Only marginal evidence for variability is found during the 11 following nights. Strong, daily line-profile variations are also observed but they cannot be easily linked to the photometric variations. Similarly to the continuum flux variations, coherent time-dependent changes are observed in 1996 in the centroid, equivalent width, and skewness of He Ii lambda 4686. Despite the generally coherent nature of the variations, we do not find evidence in our data for the periods claimed in previous studies. While the issue of a cyclical pattern of variability in {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}WR 1{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is still controversial, it is clear that this object might constitute in the future a cornerstone for our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the formation of largely anisotropic outflows in Wolf-Rayet stars.},

In this paper, we set out to verify if a simplified analytical model in which corotating interaction regions (CIRs) threading an otherwise spherical wind is able to reproduce the many broad-band continuum light curves from the literature with a reasonable set of parameters. We modified the optically thin model developed by Ignace, St-Louis \& Proulx-Giraldeau to approximately account for multiple scattering and used it to fit 13 separate data sets of this star. By including two CIRs in the wind, we obtained reasonable fits for all data sets with coherent values for the inclination of the rotation axis (i0 = 166{\textdegree}) and for its orientation in the plane of the sky, although in the latter case we obtained two equally acceptable values ($\psi$ = 63{\textdegree} and 152{\textdegree}) from the polarimetry. Additional line profile variation simulations using the Sobolev approximation for the line transfer allowed us to eliminate the $\psi$ = 152{\textdegree} solution. With the adopted configuration (i0 = 166{\textdegree} and $\psi$ = 63{\textdegree}), we were able to reproduce all data sets relatively well with two CIRs located near the stellar equator and always separated by \~{}90{\textdegree} in longitude. The epoch dependence comes from the fact that these CIRs migrate along the surface of the star. Density contrasts smaller than a factor of 2 and large opening angles for the CIR ($\beta$ ? 35{\textdegree}) were found to best reproduce the type of spectroscopic variability reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {We present a morphological study of nebulae around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars using archival narrow-band optical and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared images. The comparison among WISE images in different bands and optical images proves to be a very efficient procedure to identify the nebular emission from WR nebulae, and to disentangle it from that of the ISM material along the line of sight. In particular, WR nebulae are clearly detected in the WISE W4 band at 22 $\mu$m. Analysis of available mid-IR Spitzer spectra shows that the emission in this band is dominated by thermal emission from dust spatially coincident with the thin nebular shell or most likely with the leading edge of the nebula. The WR nebulae in our sample present different morphologies that we classified into well defined WR bubbles (bubble ?-type nebulae), clumpy and/or disrupted shells (clumpy/disrupted C-type nebulae), and material mixed with the diffuse medium (mixed ?-type nebulae). The variety of morphologies presented by WR nebulae shows a loose correlation with the central star spectral type, implying that the nebular and stellar evolutions are not simple and may proceed according to different sequences and time-lapses. We report the discovery of an obscured shell around WR 35 only detected in the infrared. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525706/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

A sample evolutionary calculation for a 60M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_ star, incorporating recent theoretical results about violent pulsational instabilities in very massive stars, is critically compared with a multitude of observational facts. The relation between those pulsational instabilities and observed line profile variability in O stars is discussed. New wind models for PCygni are computed, with particular emphasis on the determination of its mass and surface He/H-ratio. A detailed comparison of our sequence with the Galactic WR population is performed, considering newly determined surface abundances. Our results suggest a new interpretation of luminous hydrogen-rich late-type WN stars as core hydrogen burning objects, while hot WN stars with small or zero hydrogen abundance are core helium burning stars. PCygni is identified with the hydrogen shell burning phase of our sequence. The observed upper luminosity limit for Galactic hydrogen-free WN stars appears to be consistent with our picture. Hence we propose the following evolutionary sequence for very massive stars: O -\&gt; Of -\&gt; H-rich WN -\&gt; LBV -\&gt; H-poor WN -\&gt; H-free WN -\&gt; WC -\&gt; SN.},

	abstract = {We suggest that the mass lost during the evolution of very massive stars may be dominated by optically thick, continuum-driven outbursts or explosions, instead of by steady line-driven winds. In order for a massive star to become a Wolf-Rayet star, it must shed its hydrogen envelope, but new estimates of the effects of clumping in winds from O-type stars indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss massive stars above roughly 40-50 Msolar, which do not become red supergiants and for which the best alternative is mass loss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest example of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of $\eta$ Carinae, when the star shed 12-20 Msolar or more in less than a decade. Other examples are circumstellar nebulae of LBVs and LBV candidates, extragalactic $\eta$ Car analogs (the so-called supernova impostors), and massive shells around supernovae and gamma-ray bursters. We do not yet fully understand what triggers LBV outbursts or what supplies their energy, but they occur nonetheless, and they present a fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals becomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a continuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are insensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a pivotal role in the evolution and ultimate fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early universe. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would also profoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early supernovae and hypernovae thought to be the origin of long gamma-ray bursts.},

We also revise the northern sample of Paper I to provide the full list of spectroscopically classified Galactic O stars complete to B = 8, bringing the total number of published GOSSS stars to 448. Extensive sequences of exceptional objects are given, including the early Of/WN, O Iafpe, Ofc, ON/OC, Onfp, Of?p, and Oe types, as well as double/triple-lined spectroscopic binaries. The new spectral subtype O9.2 is also discussed. The magnitude and spatial distributions of the observed sample are analyzed. We also present new results from OWN, a multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic survey coordinated with GOSSS that is assembling the largest sample of Galactic spectroscopic massive binaries ever attained. The OWN data combined with additional information on spectroscopic and visual binaries from the literature indicate that only a very small fraction (if any) of the stars with masses above 15-20 M ? are born as single systems. In the future we will publish the rest of the GOSSS survey, which is expected to include over 1000 Galactic O stars.

Although it is derived that the exponent of the mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z, one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures. Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines. Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance.

We find that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars are dominated by iron lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar to that of massive OB stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind strength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend on the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black hole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies. A further finding of our study is that the Z dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker at metallicities below Z/Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ? 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once the metal abundance drops below (Z/Z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) ? 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. This is the result of an increased importance of radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such as carbon. In combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington limit - likely to be relevant for massive Population iii stars - this effect may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of these objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in enriching the intergalactic medium of the early Universe.},

	abstract = {Context. Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have a severe impact on their environments owing to their strong ionizing radiation fields and powerful stellar winds. Since these winds are considered to be driven by radiation pressure, it is theoretically expected that the degree of the wind mass-loss depends on the initial metallicity of WR stars.  Aims: Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the Milky Way, M 31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates for all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC. Based on these data, we discuss the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the mass loss and evolution of WR stars.  Methods: The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical properties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to multi-band observations.  Results: In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen abundance is detectable. The majority of these objects have stellar temperatures exceeding 75 kK, while their luminosities range from 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The WN stars in the SMC exhibit on average lower mass-loss rates and weaker winds than their counterparts in the Milky Way, M 31, and the LMC.  Conclusions: By comparing the mass-loss rates derived for WN stars in different Local Group galaxies, we conclude that a clear dependence of the wind mass-loss on the initial metallicity is evident, supporting the current paradigm that WR winds are driven by radiation. A metallicity effect on the evolution of massive stars is obvious from the HRD positions of the SMC WN stars at high temperatures and high luminosities. Standard evolution tracks are not able to reproduce these parameters and the observed surface hydrogen abundances. Homogeneous evolution might provide a better explanation for their evolutionary past. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526241/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We discuss all the relevant data, masses, luminosities, T\_eff\_, abundances, lifetimes, number ratios WR/O and WC/WN for Wolf-Rayet (WR) star models computed recently by the Geneva group. The results presented may be used directly as input data for population syntheses. The effects of enhanced mass loss rates during the main sequence and the WNL phases on the main outputs of the stellar models are studied in details. For a given metallicity, we find that models with high mass loss predict lower values for the minimum luminosity of the WR stars, lower C/He and O/He ratios at the entrance in the WC phase, and higher values of the WR/O and WC/WN number ratios when integrated over the mass spectrum. Most interestingly, we find that the ratio WC/WN is not a monotonic function of metallicity; these models predict a decrease of the ratio WC/WN for metallicities Z\&gt;=0.02 and enhanced mass loss rates. This is due to a long WNL phase obtained in models with high mass loss rates. The comparison of models and WR observations in the Milky Way shows that the mass loss rates during evolutionary phases before the WR stage are likely stronger than generally thought. We also examine the effects of binary mass transfer on the WR/O number ratios at various Z and on the way the WR are distributed among the different WR-subtypes (WNL, WNE and WC). The observed number ratios WR/O and WC/WR in nearby galaxies are particularly well accounted for. We find that at low Z values, nearly 100\% of the existing WR stars may owe their existence to binary mass transfer, while this percentage might be relatively low in inner galactic regions, where stellar winds are the dominant factor for forming WR stars and produce a lot of them. The above results are compatible with the fact that a relatively small fraction ({\textasciitilde}5\%) of O-stars have an evolution heavily influenced by binary mass transfer.},

Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss{\textemdash}are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.},

Here we investigate the impact of rotation and metallicity on stellar evolution. Using similar physics as in our previous large grids of models at Z = 0.002 and Z = 0.014, we compute stellar evolution models with the Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial masses (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ini{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) between 1.7 and 120 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and Z = 0.0004 (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium burning phase with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants only at the end of their lifetimes, and few red supergiants are expected. Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars as a results of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end their lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature that is not predicted by models with higher initial metallicities. Interestingly, due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the mass domain of stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z = 0.0004 than at Z = 0.002. We find that during the main sequence (MS) phase, the ratio between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating models at the end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ini{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 4 - 6 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are beyond the core helium burning phase and spend little time in the instability strip. Since they would evolve towards cooler effective temperatures, these Cepheids should show an increase of the pulsation period as a function of age. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The stellar evolution tracks and tables are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A24"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A24{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Grids of models of massive stars (M >= 20 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) with rotation are computed for metallicities Z ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most massive O-stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial Z value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase. Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities (\&lt;50 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more chance to reach the break-up limit. The properties of the WR populations as predicted by the rotating models are in general in much better agreement with the observations in nearby galaxies. Some possible remaining difficulties in these comparisons are mentioned. The evolution of the chemical abundances is largely influenced by rotation in all phases from the MS phase to the WN and WC phases. We also show that the interval of initial masses going through the LBV stage is changing with Z and $\Omega$. The observed variation with metallicity of the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as found by Prantzos \&amp; Boissier ({\textbackslash}cite\{Pr03\}) is very well reproduced by the rotating models, while non-rotating models predict much too low ratios. This indicates that the minimum initial masses of single stars going through a WR phase are consistently predicted. At Z = 0.040, stars with initial masses above 50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} reach a final mass at the time of supernova explosion between 5 and 7.5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, while at Z = 0.004, like in the SMC, the final masses of stars are in the range of 17-29 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. On the whole, rotation appears to be an essential parameter even for the WR properties. Detailed tables describing the evolutionary tracks are available on the web.},

For WR and O stars within 2 kpc, we find a WR/O ratio of 0.09. The distances are used to generate absolute magnitude calibrations and obtain the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram for WR stars.

	abstract = {A nearly complete sample of 24 Magellanic Cloud WC/WO subclass Wolf-Rayet stars is studied spectroscopically and photometrically to determine its binary frequency. Theory predicts the Roche lobe overflow produced Wolf-Rayet binary frequency to be 52+/-14 per cent in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 100 per cent in the Small Magellanic Cloud, not counting non-Roche lobe overflow Wolf-Rayet binaries. Lower ambient metallicity (Z) leads to lower opacity, preventing all but the most massive (hence luminous) single stars from reaching the Wolf-Rayet stage. However, theory predicts that Roche lobe overflow even in binaries of modest mass will lead to Wolf-Rayet stars in binaries with periods below approximately 200d, for initial periods below approximately 1000d, independent of Z. By examining their absolute continuum magnitudes, radial velocity variations, emission-line equivalent widths and full widths at half-maximum, a WC/WO binary frequency of only 13 per cent, significantly lower than the prediction, is found in the Large Magellanic Cloud. In the unlikely event that all of the cases with a less certain binary status actually turn out to be binary, current theory and observation would agree. (The Small Magellanic Cloud contains only one WC/WO star, which happens to be a binary.) The three WC+O binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud all have periods well below 1000d. The large majority of WC/WO stars in such environments apparently can form without the aid of a binary companion. Current evolutionary scenarios appear to have difficulty explaining either the relatively large number of Wolf-Rayet stars in the Magellanic Clouds, or the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars in general.},

For the binaries we discuss additional properties, such as wind-wind collision (WWC) effects, and the orbital parameters. With this large sample, we discuss the global properties of the WNE population, which is expected to be the most sensitive to binary evolution with respect to the influence of metallicity. To emphasize the relevance of the binary frequency test for the stellar evolution of massive stars in the LMC, we review their observational properties and provide new and meaningful evolutionary classes, which reconcile observational and theoretical definitions.

This survey concludes the decade-long effort of the Montr{\'e}al Massive Star Group to monitor every known WR star in the Magellanic Clouds except for the six crowded WNL stars in R136, which will be discussed elsewhere. The focus of our survey was to monitor the so-called WNL stars for radial velocity (RV) variability in order to identify the short- to intermediate-period (P {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 200 d) binaries among them. Our results are in line with results of previous studies of other WR subtypes, and show that the binary frequency among LMC WNL stars is statistically consistent with that of WNL stars in the Milky Way. We have identified four previously unknown binaries, bringing the total number of known WNL binaries in the LMC to nine. Since it is very likely that none but one of the binaries is classical, helium-burning WNL star, but rather superluminous, hence extremely massive, hydrogen-burning object, our study has dramatically increased the number of known binaries harbouring such objects, and thus paved the way to determine their masses through model-independent, Keplerian orbits. It is expected that some of the stars in our binaries will be among the most massive known. With the binary status of each WR star now known, we also studied the photometric and X-ray properties of our program stars using archival MACHO photometry as well as Chandra and ROSAT data. We find that one of our presumably single WNL stars is among the X-ray brightest WR sources known. We also identify a binary candidate from its RV variability and X-ray luminosity which harbours the most luminous WR star known in the Local Group.},

For the systems with 16M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\_ primaries the parameter space of initial mass ratio and orbital period is explored for the formation of contact binaries.

For the wider case A systems that avoid contact altogether, there is a limited range in initial orbital period and mass ratio where it is possible that the original secondary star reaches the end of its evolution before the primary. In particular, in massive systems the secondary may undergo a supernova explosion before the primary, leading to the ejection of this primary (a helium star) from the system. We suggest that this type of evolution may be relevant to the formation of the Crab nebula, which is helium-rich and rather far from the Galactic plane. For case B systems we find that systems with larger orbital period are more likely to come into contact, even if the primary still has a radiative envelope.},

	abstract = {Context. The currently operating space missions, as well as those that will be launched in the near future, will deliver high-quality data for millions of stellar objects. Since the majority of stellar astrophysical applications still (at least partly) rely on spectroscopic data, an efficient tool for the analysis of medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy is needed.  Aims: We aim at developing an efficient software package for the analysis of medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy of single stars and those in binary systems. The major requirements are that the code should have a high performance, represent the state-of-the-art analysis tool, and provide accurate determinations of atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for different types of stars.  Methods: We use the method of atmosphere models and spectrum synthesis, which is one of the most commonly used approaches for the analysis of stellar spectra. Our Grid Search in Stellar Parameters (gssp) code makes use of the Message Passing Interface (OpenMPI) implementation, which makes it possible to run in parallel mode. The method is first tested on the simulated data and is then applied to the spectra of real stellar objects.  Results: The majority of test runs on the simulated data were successful in that we were able to recover the initially assumed sets of atmospheric parameters. We experimentally find the limits in signal-to-noise ratios of the input spectra, below which the final set of parameters is significantly affected by the noise. Application of the gssp package to the spectra of three Kepler stars, KIC 11285625, KIC 6352430, and KIC 4931738, was also largely successful. We found an overall agreement of the final sets of the fundamental parameters with the original studies. For KIC 6352430, we found that dependence of the light dilution factor on wavelength cannot be ignored, as it has a significant impact on the determination of the atmospheric parameters of this binary system.  Conclusions: The gssp software package is a compilation of three individual program modules suitable for spectrum analysis of single stars and individual binary components. The code is highly effective and can be used for spectrum analysis of large samples of stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The gssp software package can be downloaded from {\textless}A href="http://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/meetings/binary-2015/gssp-software-package"{\textgreater}https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/meetings/binary-2015/gssp-software-package{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Modelling stellar atmospheres becomes increasingly demanding as more accurate observations draw a more complex picture of how real stars look like. What could be called a normal star becomes increasingly rare because of, e.g., significant deviations from the classical solar abundance pattern and clear evidence for stratification of elements in the atmospheres as well as surface inhomogeneities (spots) causing further severe deviations from ``standard'' atmospheres. We describe here a new code for calculating LTE plane-parallel stellar model atmospheres for early and intermediate type of stars which has been written in Compaq Fortran 95 and can be compiled for Windows and Linux/UNIX computer platforms. The code is based on modified ATLAS9 subroutines (Kurucz) and on spectrum synthesis codes written by V. Tsymbal with the main modifications of input physics concerning the block for opacity calculation. Each line contributing to opacity is taken into account for modelling the atmosphere, similar to synthetic spectrum calculations. This approach, which we call the line-by-line (LL) technique, avoids problems resulting from statistical methods (ODF, OS) and allows to calculate complex models with abundances which are not simply scaled from a standard pattern (usually the solar abundances) and which can be even depth dependent. Stratification is considered in this context as an empirical input parameter which has to be derived from observations. Due to the implemented numerical methods, mainly in the opacity calculation module, our code produces model atmospheres with modern PCs in a time comparable to that required by classical routines.},

With these measurements, we derive stellar masses of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm WR\} = 10.31{\textbackslash}pm 0.45 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm O\} = 29.27{\textbackslash}pm 1.14 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. We also include a discussion of the evolutionary history of this system from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis model grid to show that this WR star likely formed primarily through mass-loss in the stellar winds, with only a moderate amount of mass lost or transferred through binary interactions.},

	abstract = {Context. The life cycles of massive stars from the main sequence to their explosion as supernovae or gamma ray bursts are not yet fully clear, and the empirical results from spectral analyses are partly in conflict with current evolutionary models. The spectral analysis of Wolf-Rayet stars requires the detailed modeling of expanding stellar atmospheres in non-LTE. The Galactic WN stars have been comprehensively analyzed with such models of the latest stage of sophistication, while a similarly comprehensive study of the Galactic WC sample remains undone.  Aims: We aim to establish the stellar parameters and mass-loss rates of the Galactic WC stars. These data provide the empirical basis of studies of (i) the role of WC stars in the evolution of massive stars, (ii) the wind-driving mechanisms, and (iii) the feedback of WC stars as input to models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies.  Methods: We analyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using optical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations are fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for the range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter domain. Both WO stars and WN/WC transit types are also analyzed using special models.  Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than 50 Galactic WC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole Galactic WC population as far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the WC stars reside between the hydrogen and the helium zero-age main sequences, having luminosities L from 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4.9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5.6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The mass-loss rates scale very tightly with L{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}0.8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The two WO stars in our sample turn out to be outstandingly hot (?200 kK) and do not fit into the WC scheme.  Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova statistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between 20 solar masses and 45 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. In contrast to previous assumptions, it seems that WC stars in general do not descend from the most massive stars. Only the WO stars might stem from progenitors that have been initially more massive than 45 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices A and B are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary CV Serpentis (= WR113, WC8d + O8-9IV) has been a source of mystery since it was shown that its atmospheric eclipses change with time over decades, in addition to its sporadic dust production. The first high-precision time-dependent photometric observations obtained with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) space telescope in 2009 show two consecutive eclipses over the 29-d orbit, with varying depths. A subsequent MOST run in 2010 showed a seemingly asymmetric eclipse profile. In order to help make sense of these observations, parallel optical spectroscopy was obtained from the Mont Megantic Observatory (2009, 2010) and from the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (2009). Assuming these depth variations are entirely due to electron scattering in a $\beta$-law wind, an unprecedented 62 per cent increase in M? is observed over one orbital period. Alternatively, no change in mass-loss rate would be required if a relatively small fraction of the carbon ions in the wind globally recombined and coaggulated to form carbon dust grains. However, it remains a mystery as to how this could occur. There also seems to be evidence for the presence of corotating interaction regions (CIR) in the WR wind: a CIR-like signature is found in the light curves, implying a potential rotation period for the WR star of 1.6 d. Finally, a new circular orbit is derived, along with constraints for the wind collision.},

Combining all available measurements of radial velocities, we derive, for the first time, a spectroscopic orbit with period 4766 {\textpm} 66 d (13.05 {\textpm} 0.18 yr). The resulting masses, adopting i= 67 {\textdegree}, are MO= 20 {\textpm} 2 M? for the O component and MWR= 4.4 {\textpm} 1.5 M? for the WR component. These appear, respectively, approximately normal and on the low side for the given spectral types. Analysis of the intense multisite spectroscopic monitoring in 1999 shows that the C iii$\lambda$5696 and C iv$\lambda$$\lambda$5802/12 lines have the highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the C iv$\lambda$$\lambda$5802/12 and He i$\lambda$5876 lines with a period of 0.83 d, which could be related either to pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis Majoris (WR 6). Wavelet analysis of the strong emission lines of C iii$\lambda$5696 and C iv$\lambda$$\lambda$5802/12 enabled us to isolate and follow for several hours small structures (emission subpeaks) associated with density enhancements within the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star. Cross-correlating the variability patterns seen in different lines, we find a weak but significant correlation between the variability in emission lines with different ionization potentials, i.e. in lines formed at different distances from the WR stellar core. Adopting a $\beta$ wind-velocity law, from the motion of individual subpeaks we find $\beta$\~{} 5, which is significantly larger than the canonical value $\beta$? 1 found in O star winds.},

In both cases, we resolve the component stars to be separated by a few milliarcseconds. The data were collected in the H band, and provide a measure of the fractional flux for both stars in each system. We find that the WR star is the dominant H-band light source in both systems (fWR,137 = 0.59 {\textpm} 0.04; fWR,138 = 0.67 {\textpm} 0.01), which is confirmed through both comparisons with estimated fundamental parameters for WR stars and O dwarfs, as well as through spectral modelling of each system. Our spectral modelling also provides fundamental parameters for the stars and winds in these systems. The results on WR 138 provide evidence that it is a binary system which may have gone through a previous mass-transfer episode to create the WR star. The separation and position of the stars in the WR 137 system together with previous results from the IOTA interferometer provides evidence that the binary is seen nearly edge-on. The possible edge-on orbit of WR 137 aligns well with the dust production site imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope during a previous periastron passage, showing that the dust production may be concentrated in the orbital plane.},

Using a significantly revised code, we have modelled these variations assuming the emission originates from the undisturbed WR star wind and a colliding wind shock region that partially wraps around the O star. Changes to the modelling code are chiefly in the form of additional parameters, intended to refine the modelling and facilitate comparison with recent predictions arising from theoretical and hydrodynamical work. This modelling provides measurements of crucial parameters such as the orbital inclination (63.5{\textdegree} {\textpm} 2.5{\textdegree}) and thus, together with the RV orbits, the stellar masses (11.7 {\textpm} 0.9 M? for the WR star and 33.3 {\textpm} 2.0 M? for the O star). We find good agreement with expectations based on theoretical studies and hydrodynamical modelling of colliding wind systems. Moreover, it raises the exciting prospect of providing a reliable method to learn more about WR stellar masses and winds, and for studying the physics of colliding winds in massive stars.},

Based on analysis of new (i.e., 2MASS) and old (i.e., IUE) data for \~{}100 sightlines, I show that the UV, optical, and IR wavelength regimes do display coherent variations, but with too much intrinsic scatter to be considered truly correlated. A 1-parameter family can be constructed which illustrates these broad trends, but very few individual sightlines are actually well-reproduced by such a family and disagreement with the mean trends is not a sufficient condition for ``peculiarity.'' Only a very small number of extinction sightlines stand out as truly peculiar. It is likely that simple variations in the mean grain size from sightline to sightline are responsible for much of the coherent variability seen in Galactic extinction, and might also explain the ``peculiar'' extinction long-noted in the Magellanic Clouds.},
